1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Videogames,
for years the domain of outsiders

2
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:05,063
and geeks, and people who look
a bit like owls.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,449
Somewhere down the line,
gaming went mainstream

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,209
and now everyone plays them
18 hours a day, even George Alagiah.

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,929
And while that is a lie, games have
infiltrated popular culture

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,569
and fundamentally changed the way we
interact with the world.

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,609
Yes, really.

8
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,529
Now, tonight, I'll share
my personal,

9
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,769
possibly bull-headed selection of
the 25 most significant games that

10
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,849
ever there were, and we'll be
hearing from videogame insiders,

11
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,329
videogame likers, and some
reassuring, friendly, familiar faces

12
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,409
so easily spooked viewers don't
shit their own kidneys out

13
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,049
with terrified indignation.

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,649
We'll show you games that broke
out of the pixelated ghetto

15
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,769
and romped across
mainstream culture.

16
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,049
We'll see games that will make you
feel guilty, or make you cry,

17
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,129
or even introduced you
to your soulmate.

18
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,449
In fact, we'll show you nothing
less than how videogames

19
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,209
changed the world...

20
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,769
because that is the title,
so we have to.

21
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:11,895
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

22
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,649
Today, in 2013, games are almost
as commonplace as shoes.

23
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,969
Practically everyone plays them
in some form.

24
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,129
Even bacon replicant David Cameron
was reportedly addicted to the

25
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,089
jolly food slash 'em up
Fruit Ninja on the iPad.

26
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,769
But games weren't always as
graphically staggering,

27
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,129
painstakingly realistic,

28
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,489
or conceptually sophisticated
as they tend to be today.

29
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,209
No, they had to start somewhere.

30
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,969
Gaming's Big Bang happened in 1972
with the release of a simple

31
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,970
looking tennis simulator,
a game called Pong.

32
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,489
Pong, of course, was very simple.

33
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,490
You know, it begins with a black
screen, as all great moments do.

34
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,649
It's meant to be kind of table tennis

35
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,129
but it was like a moving white bar
that would go up and down,

36
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,130
and you could bounce
a ball from side to side.

37
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,329
But it was so limited,
so kind of basic in its function,

38
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,729
and yet, curiously, satisfying.

39
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,329
Pong wasn't the first videogame

40
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,089
but it was the first truly
successful one, and it contains

41
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,889
much of the same basic DNA as almost
every game that followed.

42
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,609
It was co-created by Atari founder
Nolan Bushnell

43
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,569
and programmer Allan Alcorn.

44
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,249
Without these two legendary figures,

45
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,089
there would be no videogames
industry at all.

46
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,969
I had completed the design and
we said, "Well, it plays pretty good,

47
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,689
"let's put it in a box and see
if anybody plays it."

48
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,409
And all it had was the name
Pong on it. There's no instructions,

49
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,049
there's just a coinmach.

50
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,489
And Nolan and I carried it over to
Andy Capp's Tavern,

51
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,489
put it on a barrel, and within
a short time, within a week or

52
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,490
so, the thing stopped working,
and so I went over to fix it...

53
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,009
That became full of quarters.

54
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,089
Yeah, I opened it up
and the quarters just gushed out,

55
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,969
filled my pockets with quarters
and came in the next day and said,

56
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,569
"Nolan, I think we've got...
Something is going on here."

57
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,209
And you go, "Hmm."

58
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,209
Pong was incredibly simple.
Everybody knows how to play

59
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,089
ping-pong. It was a very stylised
version of ping-pong on a TV.

60
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,569
The controls were simple,
just a knob each to move the paddle.

61
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,089
There was also hidden depth.

62
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,249
The power allowed the ball to come
off the bats in different angles,

63
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,809
depending on where you hit it,
so it introduced this whole

64
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,489
idea of skill and strategy, which is
really, really important.

65
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,490
Yes, it's hard to remember now,
but in 1972 this was cutting edge.

66
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,129
You know, I found the graphics
on Pong,

67
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,929
the little players, the little lines,
they moved quite smoothly,

68
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,809
it was quite impressive,
and the ball moved smoothly.

69
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,009
By ball, I mean square!

70
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,729
We didn't make the ball square

71
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,369
because we thought that
a square ball was cool.

72
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,329
It's the only way we could do it,

73
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,249
and so, you know, in some ways,

74
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,250
I'd say the first 10
years of the video game business,

75
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,209
we were always bumping right

76
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,210
up against the edge of the
technology that was allowed to us.

77
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,689
'You are watching
the most exciting game

78
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,729
'you'll ever see on your TV set.'

79
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,169
Technology may have held
the graphics, back but soon,

80
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,169
the rise of cheap microchips created
a wave of Pong-like imitators

81
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,569
you could plug in and enjoy in your
living room,

82
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,609
revolutionising home entertainment
at a stroke.

83
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,769
'Oops, a goal.'

84
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,529
Until Pong came along, you would
have to sit there and withstand

85
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,689
whatever the TV threw at you,
which in the '70s

86
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,129
was only a handful of channels.

87
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,769
It often meant a choice between
a documentary about bricks

88
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,209
or Jimmy Savile.

89
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,489
Now, suddenly, there was

90
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,089
a box you could plug directly
into your TV and take control.

91
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,090
At the time, the very idea of that
was mind-manglingly exciting.

92
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,169
That was the revelation,

93
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,569
the fact that you didn't feel
passive for the first time.

94
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,569
Not that you don't mind being
passive with TV,

95
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,969
but for the first time you were
doing something here that

96
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,089
translated into something over there
and that was kind of mind-blowing.

97
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,090
So I think it was just the miracle
of being in the TV and operating

98
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,250
something from your couch which was
the game changer for me.

99
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,089
I can remember gathering around it
with my whole family,

100
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,090
it was like the piano
in the 1940s or the Victorian era.

101
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,449
We all gathered around
and were amazed at this

102
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,769
idea of interacting with
the television screen.

103
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,969
Even though the graphics were
profoundly simple, there was

104
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,049
that sense that this was a whole new
thing that was happening.

105
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,689
Trad TV was clearly

106
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,609
so rattled by the obvious threat
posed by the technological

107
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,249
upstart, it made desperate
attempts to incorporate the new

108
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,849
enemy into its flagship
entertainment shows.

109
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,289
When Pong came out they tried to use
it as part of a live TV thing,

110
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,209
and I know I am not imagining this,
with Bruce Forsyth.

111
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,449
- Nice to see you to see you...
- Nice!

112
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,329
Well, what else could I say?

113
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,569
Bruce Forsyth had jumped ship from
BBC to ITV for a huge pay packet,

114
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,049
there was a huge story about that,

115
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,450
and ITV gave him
the whole of Saturday night.

116
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,449
And the competition they had,

117
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,369
they had people using a
voice-operated form of Pong.

118
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,529
I know I've seen this.

119
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,809
You're looking at me like I'm
hallucinating, but I have seen this.

120
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,730
Ladies and gentlemen, tele-tennis.

121
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,850
And even as a kid I was thinking,
"Wow, this really doesn't work."

122
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,249
In the years following Pong,

123
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,329
amusement arcades filled with
coin guzzling monoliths became

124
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,129
a common sight, but in 1978,
the success of one title

125
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,130
catapulted gaming out of the dark
and further into the mainstream.

126
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,729
This stark, bleak, humans vs aliens
fight-to-the-death quickly

127
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,609
hoovered up coins worldwide.

128
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,449
What Space Invaders did was it took
arcade machines out of those

129
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,649
arcades, out of bars and suddenly,
they were in restaurants

130
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,649
and cafes,
places where families could go.

131
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,769
I think it was the first
game that really did that.

132
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,889
It took games into the mainstream.

133
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,890
I can remember the first time
I saw Space Invaders.

134
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,689
It was at the Silver Blades
ice rink in Birmingham.

135
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,009
We were on a school trip,
on Thursday night,

136
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,449
and I remember seeing this game

137
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:10,450
and putting 10p in the slot and it
was like a revelation to me,

138
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,529
it was the most amazing experience.

139
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,369
And from then on in,
Space Invaders was my life.

140
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,769
You would get 40p dinner money
each day

141
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,529
and you could go down to the cafe
down the hill

142
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,530
and get beans on toast for 20p and
have two games of Space Invaders.

143
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,009
The pace of Space Invaders
was beautiful.

144
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,010
As a newb, who had never played,
you know, an arcade game before,

145
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,169
you could walk up, put 10p in,
and you could play for, like,

146
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,649
five or ten minutes
without being annihilated.

147
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,650
And that pace meant that it
drew people in.

148
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,689
It also satisfied something which
gamers seem to enjoy - attrition,

149
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,009
cleaning something up.

150
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,569
You have this block of stuff which
had to be cleared away.

151
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,649
It's odd, because it is something
you can never win. You clear them

152
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,689
up, there's a little pause
and they all come back again.

153
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,769
But somehow, you want to keep on
doing it.

154
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,769
Mastering Space Invaders became
an overriding obsession for many.

155
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,729
This is one of the first published
books by revered author Martin Amis.

156
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,209
It's Invasion Of
The Space Invaders.

157
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,169
A surprisingly in-depth
collection of his arcade tips with

158
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,089
a foreword by Steven Spielberg.

159
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,489
Martin Amis has since
disavowed his involvement

160
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,769
in the Space Invaders tips scene.

161
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,209
And the game's appeal wasn't simply
restricted to the

162
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,729
nature of its challenge. The sheer
experience was equally important.

163
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,730
This was the first game to evoke
a distinct mood and tone.

164
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:37,850
The music sped up as soon as aliens
got closer to you, and it was like

165
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,929
that excitement and that,

166
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,930
"Oh, this is really responding
to what I am doing."

167
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,609
It's like a heartbeat when the Space
Invaders are coming down the screen.

168
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,289
It's, "Dum, dum, dum, dum."

169
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,290
It accentuates your own tension,
it was perfect.

170
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,809
It was very stylistic.

171
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,489
You know, the shape of the alien,
as soon as you saw it,

172
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,490
you kind of understood it
and it burnt it into your mind.

173
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,609
As a result, Space Invaders wasn't
just an arcade hit,

174
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,609
but a bona fide, mainstream,
cultural phenomenon.

175
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,369
Yes, tonight, we will be discovering
just who the Space Invader

176
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,049
champion of the Midlands is!

177
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,049
Space Invaders tournaments were
considered entertaining enough

178
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,609
to be televised, for God's sake!

179
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,369
'And how Tim Coxon of Stoke
must be feeling now.'

180
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,409
And the world of cheerful children's
animation also couldn't

181
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,449
resist the pull of the global fad
of the moment.

182
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,769
Left a bit, steady.

183
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,649
Right. Right a bit, fire.

184
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,969
Every element of the Invaders
template had such an instant

185
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,049
iconic purity, it still resonates
today, with references to it

186
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,449
popping up everywhere.

187
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,369
Slick TV commercials
nod in its direction and it

188
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,370
appears on walls around the world,
courtesy of street artist Invader.

189
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,769
And Space Invaders still
survives as a game,

190
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,049
albeit in a remixed, re-imagined,
modern form.

191
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,169
I was very honoured to be
asked to do it.

192
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,289
Working on Space Invaders
is like being asked to go on stage

193
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,290
and play with Dave Gilmour out
of Pink Floyd or something like that.

194
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:13,049
Space Invaders was the catalyst
for an explosion of similarly themed

195
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,050
games in the late '70s and early
'80s as pubs, arcades and cafes

196
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,729
rang to the sound of zipping lasers
and white noise explosions.

197
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,329
The primitive graphics of the day
were ideally suited

198
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,169
for depicting basic shapes
competing for power in black

199
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,929
space, but with this incessant
focus on interstellar combat,

200
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,930
games were in danger of becoming
a chiefly male obsession.

201
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,569
To gain wide acceptance once again,

202
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,849
games would need to become
less abstract.

203
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,850
What they needed was some
kind of likeable character.

204
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,689
Pac-Man was arguably
videogaming's first mascot.

205
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,049
He is sort of the first character,
I guess, you know, the very,

206
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,249
very iconic character of videogames.

207
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,649
The designer of Pac-Man,

208
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,929
he introduced this Japanese concept
of kawaii, which is cute.

209
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,609
Lots of Japanese design is based
around this sense of kawaii,

210
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,809
cuteness.

211
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,529
And so, not only is Pac-Man
very kawaii, very cute,

212
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,049
but also, so are the ghosts.

213
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,649
He did this because he wanted to
appeal to young girls

214
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,969
and women as well as men,

215
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,289
and in fact, he said in interviews
since then, which sounds sexist now,

216
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,809
but he's thinking, "How can I
make it appeal to women?"

217
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,649
"Oh, I know, women like food."

218
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,089
So...

219
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:31,090
Famously, he'd seen images
of a pizza with a slice taken out

220
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,169
and he saw Pac-Man in that image.

221
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,249
And Pac-Man does have
a lot of character.

222
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,569
I think the reason why everything
went Pac-Man crazy for

223
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,929
a while was because he had a face.

224
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,129
Even the ghosts, even the enemies had
character, and they had names.

225
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,889
Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde.

226
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,969
They all had very distinct
personalities

227
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,049
and they did their own
thing in the maze.

228
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,169
Pac-Man's rudimentary artificial
intelligence also represented

229
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,049
a breakthrough, tricking the player
into thinking the ghosts were

230
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,409
actually alive with their own
personal traits.

231
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,129
Blinky, the red ghost,
was a fast, aggressive hunter.

232
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,129
Inky, the blue one, was a dawdler.

233
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,649
Pinky would anticipate
where you were going and try

234
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,729
and block you off,

235
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,849
while Clyde, the orange one, was
programmed to rapidly chase you

236
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,969
until he got too close,

237
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,409
at which point he'd
dart back into a corner.

238
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,049
This hidden layer of sophistication
made the ghosts seem

239
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,809
less like computerised drones

240
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,569
and more like fallible,
living characters.

241
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,449
But the Pac-Man ghosts,
I really liked.

242
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,769
And the cherry, the idea
of a floating cherry was cool.

243
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,529
And the fact that it changed
when it ate.

244
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,049
I mean, all these things were
kind of major steps forward.

245
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,849
This was the grammar of gaming being
constructed before your eyes.

246
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,449
It was the first time people thought,
"Well, why not do this?"

247
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,289
It was the first videogame to
actually feature cut scenes as well.

248
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,729
There were little humorous
cut scenes with Pac-Man

249
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,929
and the ghosts before each level.

250
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,009
You had Pac-Man being
pursued by ghosts

251
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,529
and then Pac-Man getting a giant.

252
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,129
He would turn around and chase
the ghost off the other way.

253
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,009
And one of the ghosts would get
his little rope caught and he would

254
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:58,449
come out and see his pink leg stuck,
sticking out from underneath.

255
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,409
It introduced the gentle element
of humour to game play which

256
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,529
I think helped broaden its appeal.

257
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,209
Likeable characters are big business
and Pac-Man was no exception.

258
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,209
Pac-Man, instantly after it came
out, it was so enormously popular.

259
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,729
We started seeing Pac-Man
T-shirts, Pac-Man lunchboxes,

260
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,889
there was a Pac-Man cartoon.

261
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,849
Pac-Man soon became a staple
of the cheesy American Saturday

262
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,049
morning cartoon slot,

263
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,569
winning his own goofy series as well
as some irritating commercials.

264
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,289
# Now Pac-Man isn't just
a game you play

265
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,089
# It's a crispy corn cereal
that's coming your way. #

266
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,729
Chomp, chomp, delicious!

267
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,929
For a time, no quintessentially
'80s commercial was complete

268
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,209
without a whorish cameo
from the circular pill freak.

269
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:41,889
# 7-Up cools your thirst. #

270
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:45,249
Pac-Man was on stuff. There was
a Pac-Man board game as well.

271
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,369
It was a terrible board game with
a big plastic Pac-Man that would

272
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,969
go about, gobbling up pellets
and stuff.

273
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,289
And even there was the weird
knock-off stuff as well.

274
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,729
Like, how do you badly draw a
Pac-Man? You know what I mean?

275
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,249
But a badly drawn Pac-Man.

276
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,769
That's an impressive thing
when you see some merchandise,

277
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,289
and you go, "That Pac-Man
doesn't even LOOK like Pac-Man."

278
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,889
That's when you know something
has caught on in a big way.

279
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,609
In the wake of Pac-Man's success,

280
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,769
games began to resemble
living cartoons -

281
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,849
bright, cheerful worlds, packed with
non-threatening characters.

282
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,649
A golden age entertainingly
celebrated earlier this

283
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,289
year in Pixar's charmingly evocative
film, Wreck-It Ralph.

284
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,449
My name is Wreck-It Ralph.

285
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,450
Ralph, you are bad guy, but this
does not mean you are bad guy.

286
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,569
I don't want to be
the bad guy any more.

287
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,609
So far, so twee,
but that was about to change.

288
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,809
The USA and Japan had ruled
gaming's roost

289
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,729
but now the British were coming
and we weren't interested in some

290
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,889
cute, yellow bauble, running around
a maze, gobbling dots.

291
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:44,637
We were bringing something else
with us. We were bringing anarchy.

292
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,049
The early 1980s were a heady mix
of the Iron Lady's iron fist,

293
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,049
soaring unemployment,
Charles and Di's sexless kissing

294
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,649
and this footage of
the Rubik's cube that has to be

295
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,969
included in every '80s
nostalgia montage by law.

296
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,329
All of which provided
the backdrop to a major

297
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:11,089
revolution in British homes
as the computerised future arrived.

298
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,609
Now, it doesn't look very futuristic
looking at it now

299
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,369
from the vantage point of the
future, but it did back then.

300
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,249
THAT'S how time works.

301
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,089
The explosion of home computing
that happened in the '80s was

302
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,569
almost unique to Britain...

303
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,569
because of Clive Sinclair.

304
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,969
In 1982, Sir Clive Sinclair
launched the ZX Spectrum,

305
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,970
a cut-price home computer intended to automate
staid, and some might say piss-dull tasks,

306
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,609
like spreadsheets
and home economics.

307
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,089
But more excitingly, as far
as Britain's school kids

308
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,409
were concerned,
the Spectrum could play games,

309
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,129
often rudimentary clones of existing
arcade hits, but games nonetheless,

310
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,649
and for a fraction of the price

311
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:53,369
of the swanky
American cartridge systems.

312
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,129
And, crucially, the Spectrum
wasn't a closed system.

313
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,689
You could write your own
programmes for it, your own games.

314
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,690
And if you didn't know how, there were
hundreds of available blueprints to learn from,

315
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,409
printed line by line in the back
of hobbyist magazines, like this.

316
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,169
I would come home and see my brother
playing with his computer

317
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,849
and learning to code it,
using a language called BASIC.

318
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,850
What was it?
You'd write, "10 say fuck,

319
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,689
"20 goto 10". And it would go,
"Fuck, Fuck, Fuck..."

320
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:25,289
That was my coding.
That's my coding career.

321
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,769
It spawned sort of a huge explosion
in creativity,

322
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,770
where some brilliant people
were coding in their bedrooms.

323
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,369
It was just like the punk movement.

324
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,009
The punk movement
was very much like a DIY ethic.

325
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,689
It was like, "If you can't
play guitar, fuck it,

326
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,289
"pick up a guitar and play it.

327
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,609
"It doesn't matter
if you can't do it. Do it."

328
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,089
And that is what games
were like in the early '80s.

329
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:51,090
It was like, "Don't know anything
about programming? It doesn't matter.
Try it, learn, do it, release it."

330
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:55,169
If you ask me, the ZX Spectrum
was the people's computer,

331
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,689
a true British original.

332
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,809
It didn't have
the fastest processor,
its graphics were primitive

333
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,810
and the keyboard was this
notoriously awful
dead flesh rubber catastrophe.

334
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,969
But it did have an immense range
of bizarre and imaginative games,

335
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,929
shot through with a uniquely
British sense of humour.

336
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,529
Many were almost like playable
sitcoms or comedy sketches.

337
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,049
There were hundreds of colourful,
quirky Spectrum games,

338
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:21,050
but only one came to truly
symbolise the era.

339
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,169
I mean, the first thing that
you are struck with with Manic Miner,

340
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,090
is the hideous
tune at the beginning.

341
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,769
It's a sort of aural assault.

342
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,770
It's disgusting.
And the colours as well - so garish.

343
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,089
But there was something, there was
something really kind of charming

344
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,929
and mysterious about it.

345
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,329
What's fascinating to me
now about Manic Miner is just

346
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:55,330
the excitement of the rooms
and how many rooms there were.

347
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,089
You know, all you were doing was
looking at something that,

348
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,569
I don't know, had a few different
blocks flying around.

349
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,769
But there was something really
thrilling about it.

350
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,969
What made this landmark game all
the more unusual was that it was

351
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,489
written in just six weeks by
a 17-year-old called Matthew Smith.

352
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,169
Every single Spectrum owner

353
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,969
in Britain had that game,
that's how good it was.

354
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,409
It's absolutely chock full
of humour.

355
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,929
The game is very much Matthew Smith.

356
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,049
The guy's a legend and rightly so,

357
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,849
and Manic Miner is his signature.

358
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,569
Manic Miner makes it onto our list

359
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,969
for being the quintessential
Spectrum game -

360
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,249
an idiosyncratic, peculiarly
British home brew classic,

361
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,250
still celebrated today in clever,
fan-created homages on the internet.

362
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,129
The Spectrum's chief rival was
the all-American Commodore 64,

363
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,049
a more powerful and altogether
more confident system, marketed

364
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:52,050
with the emphasis on fun in
impossibly wonderful advertisements.

365
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,689
# Are you keeping up with
the Commodore?

366
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,129
# Because the Commodore
is keeping up with you... #

367
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,369
Commodore games had slicker graphics
and far superior sound.

368
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,289
And as well as its
slew of American imports,

369
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:05,169
it still had room
for oddball British titles.

370
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,409
One of the games
I remember most fondly and that

371
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,329
I'm most pleased to have been
involved with

372
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,289
was my old game Hover Bovver.
Primarily because

373
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,209
that was a collaboration in design
with me and my dad.

374
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,169
It's another one of these silly,
British comedy games that

375
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,649
just arose one morning
when we were sitting in a place

376
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,449
where there was somebody mowing
a lawn outside.

377
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,049
We just started tossing back

378
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,249
and forth this idea of a comedic
game where somebody was

379
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,250
mowing a lawn and there could be
a dog which gets in the way.

380
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,850
I mean, it was all very
Terry and June, you know? But...

381
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,049
it ended up being a really fun
little game.

382
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,809
But it wasn't all
rosy in the British gaming garden.

383
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,209
It wasn't like a club, no.

384
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,529
Commodore and Spectrum owners
didn't like each other, at all.

385
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,249
Long before Blur versus Oasis,

386
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,250
or any other of those hideous
media inventions of fake clashes,

387
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:59,489
the Commodore versus Spectrum
debate was a civil war,

388
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,490
a geek civil war, whose repercussions
can still be felt to this day.

389
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,809
The Spectrum was British, you know,

390
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:09,369
it was kind of the local favourite
and all that. But...

391
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,889
you always knew, tell me,
you always knew, didn't you,

392
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,049
you always knew that you had
the lesser machine.

393
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,249
Essentially, you would be driving
your Triumph, and that's great.

394
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,449
And then we'd pull up in a Cadillac,

395
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,450
which essentially, the Commodore 64
was, with its big, clacky keys.

396
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,489
Shift, run, stop, loads and plays.

397
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,209
Still, despite their rivalry,

398
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,449
Spectrum and Commodore owners could
unite on one key issue,

399
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,169
and that was that owners of
the third system - the BBC Micro -

400
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,409
very much the Liberal Democrats
of the computer world,

401
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,849
THEY were dicks.

402
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,089
The BBC Micro was a chunky,
middle-class computer

403
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,929
created for the BBC's
Computer Literacy Project -

404
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,489
a jolly, well-meaning attempt
to get Britain coding,

405
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,409
courtesy of jolly, well-meaning,

406
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,689
but not notably
sexy edutainment shows

407
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,409
like Making the Most of the Micro.

408
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,049
I've got here
a listing of the programme that

409
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,529
I have taken off the printer.

410
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,530
And it's a reasonably sized
programme for a microcomputer.

411
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,169
Little wonder the computer itself
had a bit of an image problem.

412
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,889
The BBC was for people
who were a bit posh,

413
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,009
because that was
quite an expensive machine.

414
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,809
So if you were BBC,
you were a bit posh.

415
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,089
I was a BBC Micro guy.

416
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:23,529
The squidgy keyboard Spectrum...
I mean, I just laughed at it!

417
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,889
Square it may well have been,

418
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,929
but the BBC was soon blessed
with a killer app of its own -

419
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,809
a game that didn't just promise
you the world, but handed you

420
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,449
an entire universe, then let you
do with you wanted in it.

421
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,970
A game called Elite.

422
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,849
These spartan,
monochrome wire-frame graphics,

423
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,849
primitive by today's standards,
were stunning at the time.

424
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,609
But that was only the start of it.

425
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,689
Elite came out in 1984,

426
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,690
and it was really a ground-breaking
game on so many levels.

427
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,689
It was impossibly big.

428
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,690
You know, what Elite did was it
simulated the entire universe.

429
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,209
It didn't do anything by halves.

430
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,689
Elite was made by two incredibly
intelligent university

431
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,369
students called Ian Bell
and David Braburn.

432
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,370
And technologically it was
a massive, massive achievement,

433
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,249
because you have got these enormous
galaxies into 32K,

434
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,729
which you couldn't even open
a Word document without now.

435
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,809
That game feels like
it fell through a time hole

436
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,769
from 20 years in the future, it
shouldn't have existed back then.

437
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,929
Both technologically
and also in terms of what

438
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:36,930
they were trying to achieve
in creating a living, 3D world.

439
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,529
Elite wasn't just a technical
marvel, but a conceptual one.

440
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,489
Until then, almost every game
told you, the player, what to do.

441
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,449
There were rules
and you had to follow them,

442
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,849
punching buttons like a lab rat.

443
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,689
Elite jettisoned
the rule book into space

444
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,690
and let you get on
with absolutely anything.

445
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,129
It was the first,
what we would call a sandbox game,

446
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,769
or an open world game.

447
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,369
You can play the game in any way you
want, it's not linear any more.

448
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,609
Suddenly you are given
a playing environment

449
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:09,610
and you can choose to do Mission A
first or Mission D first.

450
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,209
You can also choose not to do
any missions, you can

451
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,649
just go out there
and explore if you want to.

452
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,650
Suddenly you could really control
your entertainment experience in ways
that were never possible before.

453
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:26,409
The fantasy of exploring a limitless
galaxy is a seductive one,

454
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,569
hence the success of
memorable exercises

455
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:32,129
in wish fulfilment like the camp
but lovable Star Trek, or the

456
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:36,130
rambling, picaresque shenanigans of
space-hopping hobo Doctor Who.

457
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,009
Those interstellar bumbags
had all the fun.

458
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:45,010
Now, thanks to Elite, you could explore
the universe like Kirk or the Doctor.

459
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,969
But unlike them, you didn't have
a deep space travel card, no.

460
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,529
You had to pay your way
by trading goods.

461
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,969
And the quickest way
to earn big money

462
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,489
was to trade illegal stuff,
like slaves or narcotics.

463
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,409
Just like Doctor Who doesn't.

464
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,929
Massive bastards could even
turn to piracy,

465
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,729
blowing up other ships
and stealing their cargo.

466
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,649
I had always seen Elite as...

467
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:11,529
Imagine the 17th, 18th, 19th century
of sailing ships

468
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:14,529
going across the Atlantic,
trading all sorts of goods.

469
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:17,089
You know, should you just cover
the normal things,

470
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,929
or should you cover the things
that were deeply illegal?

471
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:23,930
We wanted the player to have the
freedom to do good and to do bad.

472
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,689
It was, like,
kind of Thatcher in space.

473
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,769
It was make money in this universe,
however you want to do it.

474
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,409
If you want to sell slaves,
if you want to sell narcotics,

475
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,609
if that's the way to do it,
even though there was

476
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,249
risk involved, that's what you did.

477
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,409
If you can imagine in the mid-1980s,

478
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,410
we were at the height of capitalism
and the economics of life

479
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,970
and the politics of life as well,
were reflected inside the game.

480
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,969
It wasn't overtly meant to be
political at all, but I think

481
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,970
it sort of, as a sort of child of
its time, it sort of became that way

482
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,849
because of the money focus
of the game.

483
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,729
You found yourself playing the game
because you wanted that

484
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,129
docking computer, you wanted
that large cargo bay or whatever.

485
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,929
And you aspired to the next
bit of money

486
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,209
and you would do anything
in the game to just try

487
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,210
and get that little extra bit
because you wanted it so much.

488
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,889
There are so many new
concepts in that game,

489
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:21,289
it was such a leap forward
that I think for publishers and for

490
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:24,649
the audience at the time, it took a
while to get their head around it.

491
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,889
But once they understood what was
possible, that you could

492
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:31,689
create worlds inside a computer,
that was just absolutely amazing.

493
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,409
Elite gave birth to an entire genre
of open world sandbox games,

494
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,329
in which the player is largely free
to create their own narrative.

495
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,049
The most famous example
being the gleefully anarchic

496
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:44,969
and morally wonky Grand Theft Auto,
which we'll return to later.

497
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,129
So, Britain had enjoyed a mini
renaissance of early gaming,

498
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,769
but the rest of the world wasn't
just sitting around, giving up

499
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,129
and going, "Pffff..."

500
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:55,009
Thousands of miles away,
somewhere terrifyingly foreign,

501
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,289
a boffin was working on a game

502
00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:00,009
so nightmarishly addictive, it would
soon enslave all of mankind

503
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,609
and destroy the world as we knew it.
Kind of.

504
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:09,090
You'll have to watch the next part
to see if I've oversold that.

505
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,409
# Try not to use me

506
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,369
# Try not to use me... #

507
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,089
The year is 1985 and as
an audience of millions

508
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,289
pretends to live in harmony
while withstanding

509
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,849
this fucking excruciating Duran
Duran performance at Live Aid,

510
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,329
the world is in flux.

511
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,449
Riots are tearing
across the United Kingdom

512
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:34,450
and not even the glittering Royal Premiere
of Back To The Future can stem that chaos,

513
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:38,849
chiefly because the two events
are entirely unrelated.

514
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,609
Meanwhile, something was about to
happen in the world of gaming

515
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,049
that was on a par with the Beatles
releasing their first single

516
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:49,050
but with catchier music.

517
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,769
When Mario first appeared

518
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,689
as the protagonist in
the challenging Donkey Kong,

519
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,409
he was known only as Jumpman.

520
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,649
A few years later he popped up

521
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,449
in the somewhat bare-boned
platformer Mario Bros

522
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,329
but it wasn't until 1985 and
the release of Super Mario Bros

523
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:11,249
that he became an instantly
recognisable icon.

524
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:15,249
Super Mario Bros is a side scrolling
platform game where basically

525
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,889
you have to run from left to right,
going up ladders, down pipes,

526
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:22,890
jumping on monsters,
collecting gold coins.

527
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:27,730
He's just a masterpiece
of minimalist design.

528
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:33,570
You get his personality from just
this tiny, tiny bit of information.

529
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,049
His design actually came from

530
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,409
the limitations of the console
at the time,

531
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,889
you know, the blue overalls,
the red cap, the moustache,

532
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,329
all of which came about because

533
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,009
they couldn't really render
anything more complex than that.

534
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,409
So it was red, white,
blue and black for a moustache,

535
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,929
it was as simple as that,
and it was born of necessity.

536
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,249
That's why it's curious
that he's become

537
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,729
the kind of iconic brand
character that he is now.

538
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,129
Mario just means games to me,
if I'm being honest.

539
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:01,409
Always friendly,
always beautiful to play,

540
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,809
like ALWAYS beautiful to play.

541
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,209
It has never really failed

542
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:08,210
and I think that Mario represents
all the right stuff in gaming,

543
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:13,610
all that pure fun stuff,
the essence is all there in Mario.

544
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:18,170
Again, it's this idea of complexity
hidden behind simplicity

545
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,449
so the Super Mario games look
simple, they look beautiful,

546
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,649
they look like they're for everybody
and they are,

547
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:27,650
but they're also really,
really difficult games, you know?

548
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,129
'Oh, you idiot!'

549
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,249
It is the hallmark of just how
well judged

550
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,969
Mario's level of difficulty is -

551
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,129
in the process of playing it
you'll die hundreds,

552
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,649
if not thousands of times,

553
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:44,449
but each time, you'll blame
yourself, not the game.

554
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,489
And it's that constant sense that
next time you can do better

555
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,649
that spurs you on
and keeps you playing.

556
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,369
Argh!

557
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:55,249
In fact, the Mario platforming
format is so compelling

558
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,689
it appeals to absolutely everyone

559
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,689
from the under fives
to the under fatwas.

560
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:04,609
I've become a master
of the Nintendo machine.

561
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,969
I think I've become very
good at defeating

562
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,529
all sorts of tiny little
two-dimensional enemies.

563
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,729
Yes, Salman Rushdie
became a Mario addict

564
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,369
during his virtual house arrest.

565
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:18,529
He even put his addiction to good
use with his children's novel,

566
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,929
Luka And The Fire Of Life, seemingly
directly inspired by the game.

567
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,449
In this, the hero traverses levels,
saves his progress

568
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:27,529
and has multiple lives, which
probably seems like a particularly

569
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:31,530
brilliant concept when you're living
under a death sentence.

570
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,489
You can't really talk about
Super Mario's success without

571
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:41,490
talking about Koji Kondo's
music design.

572
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:48,570
Mario's music was brilliant
because every melody is memorable.

573
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,210
There were so many of them.

574
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,529
And that's the sickest one, I think.

575
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:09,530
I swear, any rapper would just be
like, that's the best rap beat ever.

576
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:15,450
'Labrinth, come in.'

577
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,049
I think video games have influenced

578
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,089
my whole reason for wanting
to make the music I make.

579
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,969
You know, that kind of 8-bit energy,
16-bit energy.

580
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,369
It's kind of inspired a lot,

581
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:30,370
especially a lot of the earlier
stuff I made with Tinie massively.

582
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:35,249
It just had a very important effect
on the way I think about music

583
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,209
and see music
and get inspired with music as well.

584
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,849
Mario was created by
Shigeru Miyamoto,

585
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:44,850
seen here winning
a BAFTA in celebratory scenes.

586
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,929
No other game designer has ever been
able to replicate

587
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,809
the sheer joy of exploration

588
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:53,769
and childhood wonder
like Shigeru Miyamoto.

589
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,889
People talk about Miyamoto as
the Spielberg of game design.

590
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,129
He very much is.

591
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:01,769
He's a man who creates wonder
on the screen like no-one else.

592
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,969
In fact, Miyamoto isn't
just the Spielberg

593
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,449
but the Walt Disney of games,

594
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:08,249
responsible for an unprecedented
number of treats including

595
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,729
the beautifully designed
and widely beloved Zelda series.

596
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,289
Unlike many video game mascots,

597
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,889
which tend to be
a Crash Bandicoot in the pan,

598
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,209
Miyamoto's creations have
endured largely

599
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,689
because the games they appear in
tend to be very well made.

600
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,169
Mario, in particular, has become
almost a kitemark of quality.

601
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,689
If you've grown-up with Mario,
then he's part of your life

602
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,929
and so there are now parents

603
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,529
who want their children
to experience Super Mario

604
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,849
and have the excitement and
joy of problem solving and

605
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:38,850
winning games that they did
with the Mario characters.

606
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,969
It's a joy
to watch my children enjoying it.

607
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,929
Back on Earth in 1989,
the Berlin Wall fell,

608
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,649
marking the end of the Cold War
and the eastern bloc.

609
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,529
And these weren't the only
tumbling blocks

610
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:53,530
and falling bricks the Soviets
had to contend with.

611
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:04,009
I think there's been puzzles
throughout the ages

612
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,849
and I think Tetris
is the perfect incarnation

613
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,769
of a traditional puzzle game

614
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,809
in video game form.

615
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,449
Everybody is familiar with putting
puzzle pieces together

616
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,969
and it just combined that
with reflexes

617
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,409
and that's kind of like the perfect
melding of two worlds,

618
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,889
like sports and puzzles.

619
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,609
When video games started out they
were things anyone could play,

620
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,769
like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong,

621
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,809
things literally anybody
could understand.

622
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,969
Tetris is just like that.

623
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:31,929
Games have got more complicated but
Tetris was "fit shapes together".

624
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:35,209
The minute you learn how to play
Tetris you've already succeeded at it

625
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:37,569
and there's not many games you can
say that about.

626
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:40,089
The minute you learn,
"Oh, this block goes in here,

627
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:43,609
"this fits in here, then that
fits in here, that goes boom,"

628
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,729
and you've already
succeeded right away.

629
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,049
The minute you learn it,
you're winning at it.

630
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,849
I think that's the magic of Tetris,

631
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:53,850
that's what makes it completely
compelling right from the start.

632
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,449
It's just a design
that's so perfect

633
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,450
that every single game designer
who looks at that thinks,

634
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:03,369
"I really wish
I could've made that."

635
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:07,049
It's so simple but so beautiful.

636
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,809
Tetris's straightforward design

637
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:11,289
was largely a result of the way
it was created.

638
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,449
Computer engineer
Alexey Pajitnov wrote it on

639
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,809
the defiantly non-gamesy,

640
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:19,810
Soviet and utilitarian
Electronica 60 terminal.

641
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,929
It was pretty much at the dying
embers of the Cold War.

642
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:27,849
It was one of the first products
that moved from east to west

643
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,449
and, interestingly, he never actually
made any money out of it

644
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,609
until very, very recently

645
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,610
because it was effectively
owned by the Russian government.

646
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,369
Tetris was perhaps the first game
that was compelling

647
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,969
to the point of being addictive.

648
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,970
While playing, you were dimly aware
that some kind of irrational appeal

649
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,209
had completely gripped your mind.

650
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:49,889
It was like a sickness,
absolutely like a sickness,

651
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:53,009
because it was a constant, "Can
I do this? I can do it, I've won.

652
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,889
"Can I do this? I've won. I've won.
I've won. I've won. I've won."

653
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,489
Panic, panic, panic, and then
eventually, you would lose,

654
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:01,889
but there was always, success was always
just a couple of button presses away,

655
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,009
it was always a couple of button
presses away

656
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,569
so it was just a constant reward.

657
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:09,009
There's a concept called flow
in video game playing

658
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:12,289
and in fact it happens
outside of video game play as well.

659
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:16,289
It's where a person will be
completely immersed

660
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,809
and engaged in the task at hand

661
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:22,810
and everything else just disappears
and falls to the wayside.

662
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:26,970
Years ago, the repetitive nature
of knitting was quite often used

663
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,649
to help people with low-level
mental health issues,

664
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:32,289
low-level depression,

665
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:35,609
and Tetris is a similar kind of
environment to that.

666
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:39,610
If you handed me Tetris right now
I would play for an hour happily.

667
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:44,610
Tetris, for me,
was a hugely significant game

668
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:48,289
because it was the first game
I ever got on my Game Boy,

669
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:52,290
which was basically your conduit to
life and entertainment as a child.

670
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,689
Bundling Tetris with every Game Boy
was a masterstroke.

671
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:58,769
Here was an addiction you could
carry around with you for

672
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:02,529
a cheeky hit now and then, just like
cigarettes but a bit less deathy.

673
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,569
I dread to think how many bus stops
and train stops were missed

674
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,929
because of it but it was that sort
of thing, you could just take it out

675
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:11,969
of your pocket and play it whenever
you had any moment of downtime.

676
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,129
And that's something we're still
seeing today with mobile phones.

677
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,009
Its lineage leads to things
like Angry Birds -

678
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:21,129
the whole kind of
casual mobile scene

679
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,849
pretty much had its ancestry
in the likes of Tetris.

680
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:27,729
Even as the Russians were chalking
up their first big hit with Tetris,

681
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,849
meanwhile on our side
of the Iron Curtain,

682
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:33,369
Hollywood was starting to get
seriously involved in the games industry.

683
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:37,370
Games were being created by the
people who brought you Star Wars.

684
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:42,289
You know, Star Wars.

685
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,649
What was interesting straightaway
about the LucasArts studio

686
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:49,569
was it was under the umbrella of
Lucasfilm, George Lucas's company,

687
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:52,889
so it was the first connection
between film and games.

688
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:55,849
LucasArts started and it had
a mandate

689
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,569
to stay small and not lose any money

690
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:02,409
and to be the best, I think,
were the three slogans they had.

691
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,329
And also, don't use Star Wars.

692
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:08,330
George wanted this new company
to stand on its own legs.

693
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,729
Early LucasArts efforts were
action games which,

694
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,369
while technically cutting-edge,
didn't have much impact.

695
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,769
What these games were missing
was a coherent story,

696
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,889
something you'd think Hollywood
would excel at.

697
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:21,129
The first attempts at computerised
interactive fiction

698
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,889
such as Zork, here, consisted of
nothing but text on a screen -

699
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,969
a kind of playable novella
you navigated through

700
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:31,649
by typing in instructions like
"go north" and "get lamp".

701
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,369
This spectrum adaptation
of The Hobbit added crude

702
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,969
graphics to the sea of text -
not quite Peter Jackson.

703
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:39,569
It wasn't until LucasArts turned
the genre into a point

704
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,689
and click cartoon that interactive
storytelling came of age.

705
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,209
When anyone asks me
what my favourite video game is,

706
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:49,210
it's not your Grand Theft Autos or
Call Of Dutys, it's Monkey Island.

707
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:58,009
The Secret Of Monkey Island

708
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,009
was a brilliantly realised
comic adventure

709
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,729
overflowing with
character and charm.

710
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,569
What I loved about the Monkey Island
series was the fact that they

711
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,569
were a bit romantic at times,
the main character, the protagonist,

712
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,809
was a guy was a guy by the name of
Guybrush Threepwood,

713
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,129
a wannabe pirate who just really
didn't have it in him.

714
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,809
He didn't have the guts, he didn't
have the nous to become this

715
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:19,409
famous pirate
that he'd always wanted to be.

716
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,289
We had Elaine Marley,
the love interest.

717
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,489
She was funny,
the script was excellent.

718
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,329
The main antagonist, the main baddie,

719
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,089
was a ghost pirate by the name of
LeChuck.

720
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,489
I love that character so much,

721
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:32,490
I've actually got a tattoo
on my leg of the man himself.

722
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:35,009
Not only is it a beautifully
programmed game

723
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:38,049
and wonderful looking - really
lovely visuals, really distinctive,

724
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,049
but at the same time

725
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:43,369
it also had a very strong character
sense of humour about it.

726
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:47,370
You know, a tone, basically, in the
way that a good movie has a tone.

727
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,849
So few games are genuinely funny

728
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:56,009
and this game was not only funny
in its writing,

729
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,649
It used its mechanics to set up
a lot of the comedy.

730
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,089
There's a sword fight in Monkey
Island that you have to win

731
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,409
but the way you win it is not by
being better with a sword

732
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,769
but by having
the funnier comebacks.

733
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,569
They are basically insult
sword fights.

734
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:10,449
The character you're fighting
against will insult you in some way

735
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,729
and then you've got
various choices of what's

736
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:15,289
the funniest retort,
what's the funniest comeback.

737
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:19,209
As you win the argument, as you win
the fight of witty rejoinders,

738
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:23,209
the fight would go in the same
direction.

739
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:26,449
I mean, we were certainly influenced
on Monkey Island by The Simpsons

740
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:29,769
but also, I think,
Monty Python in a way.

741
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:32,089
What the Holy Grail was doing to
the Arthurian legend

742
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,489
we were hoping to do to pirates.

743
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:36,489
Fittingly, for a game forged
from many different influences,

744
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:39,809
some believe Monkey Island turned
out to be quite influential itself,

745
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,929
pointing out
similarities between the game

746
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:45,049
and the vastly entertaining
Pirates Of The Caribbean movies.

747
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:48,649
Both the game and the film feature
a reluctant swashbuckler

748
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,049
who attempts to rescue his
wisecracking love interest

749
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:54,329
from a motley crew of zombie pirates
with a scary undead leader.

750
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:57,369
There are even individual moments
that seem vaguely familiar.

751
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:00,609
For instance, here, Guybrush
Threepwood solves a problem by using

752
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:04,610
a coffin as a boat, a bit like Jack
Sparrow did in Dead Man's Chest.

753
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:09,050
Sorry, mate.

754
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:13,529
Mind if we make a little side trip?

755
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:16,769
I didn't think so.

756
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,929
All of which, I'm sure,
is a total coincidence.

757
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,369
It's hard for me
to watch those movies

758
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:25,209
and not see little glimpses of
Monkey Island in them,

759
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:29,089
but Monkey Island was based on the
Pirates Of The Caribbean ride.

760
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:31,249
That was my whole
influence for that game,

761
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,489
so it's kind of a full circle thing.

762
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:36,329
Monkey Island earns a place
on our list for bringing

763
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:39,209
cinematic storytelling techniques
to interactive fiction

764
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,889
and its spirit lives on in advanced
contemporary games

765
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,889
like the grim murder mystery,
LA Noire,

766
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:47,890
and this year's flawed
but interesting Beyond Two Souls.

767
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,169
They're impressive,
but a bit po-faced.

768
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,969
Nothing since has had
the humour of Monkey Island.

769
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,529
All this stuff about spinning yarns
was all well and good

770
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:06,369
but when would games learn to
focus on the really important things

771
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,249
like teaching children how to
maim and kill?

772
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:13,250
The answer, fortunately, was soon.

773
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,150
Bang!

774
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,649
The early '90s were
brimming with firsts -

775
00:40:24,724 --> 00:40:28,043
the first President Bush was
gleefully waging the first Gulf War.

776
00:40:28,044 --> 00:40:30,083
The first McDonald's
opened in Russia!

777
00:40:30,084 --> 00:40:31,963
And something called
the World Wide Web

778
00:40:31,964 --> 00:40:34,283
became publicly accessible
for the first time.

779
00:40:34,284 --> 00:40:35,923
Popular youth culture, meanwhile,

780
00:40:35,924 --> 00:40:38,403
was entranced by slackerdom
and the grunge scene,

781
00:40:38,404 --> 00:40:41,883
as detailed on gaudy
entertainment shows like The Word.

782
00:40:41,884 --> 00:40:44,243
But there was also
a new wave of cultural icons,

783
00:40:44,244 --> 00:40:48,083
hailing from Japan, whose
specialist subject on Mastermind

784
00:40:48,084 --> 00:40:52,084
would've been kicking
the shit out of each other.

785
00:41:00,004 --> 00:41:04,003
Street Fighter II looks incredible.
It's the game that made gaming cool.

786
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:06,003
Arcades had to draft in
more machines

787
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:08,323
just to accommodate
for the demand for it,

788
00:41:08,324 --> 00:41:09,843
you know, it was just such a...

789
00:41:09,844 --> 00:41:12,683
such a huge, huge phenomenon.

790
00:41:12,684 --> 00:41:14,483
Street Fighter II is a prime example

791
00:41:14,484 --> 00:41:17,003
of why games are good, cos
you've got a friend and you say,

792
00:41:17,004 --> 00:41:19,763
"Let's just have a reasonable
game of Street Fighter."

793
00:41:19,764 --> 00:41:22,723
"Yeah, sure, let's have a game
of Street Fighter." And you end up

794
00:41:22,724 --> 00:41:25,803
screaming at them, "I'm going to
kill you! I'm going to kill you!"

795
00:41:25,804 --> 00:41:28,363
But it was great,
cos it was competitive and it was

796
00:41:28,364 --> 00:41:31,243
so unlike anything that I'd ever
played before, to be honest,

797
00:41:31,244 --> 00:41:34,404
cos it's just two characters
punching each other in the face.

798
00:41:40,884 --> 00:41:42,723
It was definitely competitive,

799
00:41:42,724 --> 00:41:45,083
especially when you play
with bad winners.

800
00:41:45,084 --> 00:41:46,403
I called them bad winners,

801
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:48,763
because, while they're
knocking you the hell out,

802
00:41:48,764 --> 00:41:51,083
they're just like,
"Yeah! Bam! Take that!"

803
00:41:51,084 --> 00:41:53,883
And you just... You're just
getting totally trashed up!

804
00:41:53,884 --> 00:41:55,803
You lose!

805
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,723
There have always been
head-to-head games -

806
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,923
Pong was a head-to-head game -
but they tended to be

807
00:41:59,924 --> 00:42:02,603
simple test of reflexes,
until Street Fighter II came along.

808
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:05,083
This too was a test of reflexes,
but also, crucially,

809
00:42:05,084 --> 00:42:07,323
a test of memory,
agility and strategy.

810
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:10,283
Now, unless you know what's
going on, it looks fairly mindless,

811
00:42:10,284 --> 00:42:13,403
but it's actually far more
complex than it appears.

812
00:42:13,404 --> 00:42:16,403
I think the key thing
about Street Fighter II was that

813
00:42:16,404 --> 00:42:19,643
it popularised the idea of
complexity in control systems.

814
00:42:19,644 --> 00:42:22,563
It was one of the first games to
introduce the idea of special moves,

815
00:42:22,564 --> 00:42:25,763
so each of the colourful characters
have their own way of fighting.

816
00:42:25,764 --> 00:42:28,323
To perform, say,
Ryu's Rising Dragon Fist,

817
00:42:28,324 --> 00:42:31,483
your fingers have to perform quite
a complex dance on the controllers.

818
00:42:31,484 --> 00:42:34,443
You have to memorise then perform
this move at lightning speed,

819
00:42:34,444 --> 00:42:37,363
which makes it a bit like
mastering a musical instrument.

820
00:42:37,364 --> 00:42:39,123
Someone playing Street Fighter II

821
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:42,363
is making hundreds of strategic
decisions at lightning speed.

822
00:42:42,364 --> 00:42:44,603
It's basically scissors,
paper, stone,

823
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:47,163
but on a bewilderingly
complex scale.

824
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:50,403
People playing Street Fighter II now,
they're still really competitive,

825
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:52,603
and they're doing
frame-by-frame analysis

826
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:56,123
of where the vulnerable windows are,
and when you can use which attack,

827
00:42:56,124 --> 00:42:59,163
and what blocks what
and what doesn't block what

828
00:42:59,164 --> 00:43:01,203
and it's, um, it's just crazy.

829
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:03,643
That's why it's so satisfying
when you win.

830
00:43:03,644 --> 00:43:05,683
You aren't simply thumping
someone in the face.

831
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:07,923
You're outwitting
and outperforming them,

832
00:43:07,924 --> 00:43:09,564
while thumping them in the face.

833
00:43:12,004 --> 00:43:15,083
Street Fighter II influenced
a whole raft of other "beat 'em ups"

834
00:43:15,084 --> 00:43:18,203
of growing complexity, such
as the phenomenal Tekken series,

835
00:43:18,204 --> 00:43:21,083
which, as you can see,
became increasingly more violent.

836
00:43:21,084 --> 00:43:23,843
Still, at least no-one's ever
inspired to actually do that

837
00:43:23,844 --> 00:43:26,843
kind of thing in real life, as
a consequence of playing the game.

838
00:43:26,844 --> 00:43:30,283
I remember, when I was a kid,
my brothers, um,

839
00:43:30,284 --> 00:43:33,443
made me fight with another kid
and it was just like a little

840
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:37,123
kind of spar with another
young kid that was my age.

841
00:43:37,124 --> 00:43:39,883
Everybody thought
I was going to lose and, um...

842
00:43:39,884 --> 00:43:43,163
I actually
used Tekken moves to win!

843
00:43:43,164 --> 00:43:46,603
It was so dumb,
but I actually won!

844
00:43:46,604 --> 00:43:50,604
With my dodgy little
Eddy Gordo moves.

845
00:43:50,884 --> 00:43:54,243
My missus still laughs at me about
that, like, I remember my brother

846
00:43:54,244 --> 00:43:57,803
saying it around the table and I was
like, "Oh, shit, I actually did it!"

847
00:43:57,804 --> 00:44:00,283
That's how much I was into Tekken!
It's so wrong!

848
00:44:00,284 --> 00:44:03,083
Oh, well, at least they're just
kicking and punching each other.

849
00:44:03,084 --> 00:44:06,044
It's not like games are full of
people running around shooting guns!

850
00:44:08,404 --> 00:44:10,283
By 1993, there have been a few games

851
00:44:10,284 --> 00:44:13,883
in which you shoot people with guns
from a first-person perspective,

852
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:17,243
like the fun Nazi-culling excursion
Wolfenstein 3D,

853
00:44:17,244 --> 00:44:19,363
but it was the release
of our next game

854
00:44:19,364 --> 00:44:23,364
that truly cemented
their place in history.

855
00:44:27,284 --> 00:44:30,243
Doom was a flabbergasting,
ultraviolent descent

856
00:44:30,244 --> 00:44:33,083
into bloody hell!
The first time I saw Doom,

857
00:44:33,084 --> 00:44:37,084
my jaw was on the floor,
it was absolutely stunning!

858
00:44:40,324 --> 00:44:43,803
Doom was one of the big "holy shit"
moments in games history.

859
00:44:43,804 --> 00:44:47,483
I remember, I had been working
at PC Gamer for about a year

860
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:49,723
when that had come out
and, you know,

861
00:44:49,724 --> 00:44:51,603
we were experienced
video game people.

862
00:44:51,604 --> 00:44:53,763
You know, we all did that
for a living.

863
00:44:53,764 --> 00:44:55,563
And Doom was
one of those moments where,

864
00:44:55,564 --> 00:44:59,203
the first time we saw it,
we were like, "What is this?"

865
00:44:59,204 --> 00:45:01,723
The modern-day shooter is
Doom, essentially.

866
00:45:01,724 --> 00:45:04,883
Id Design effectively created
the first-person shooter,

867
00:45:04,884 --> 00:45:06,843
with Wolfenstein, before Doom.

868
00:45:06,844 --> 00:45:10,844
Doom popularised it, because it was
the perfect implementation, I think,

869
00:45:10,964 --> 00:45:14,964
at that time of the idea of seeing,
of you inhabiting the character,

870
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:18,843
and the camera view
being your view of the world.

871
00:45:18,844 --> 00:45:21,923
In fact, this ground-breaking
first-person viewpoint

872
00:45:21,924 --> 00:45:23,403
was actually a happy accident.

873
00:45:23,404 --> 00:45:27,083
The reason why we made the games
first-person when we started was

874
00:45:27,084 --> 00:45:29,123
because it took less processor time

875
00:45:29,124 --> 00:45:31,843
to actually not draw
a character in front of you,

876
00:45:31,844 --> 00:45:33,843
so the game can go faster
because of it.

877
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:37,443
There was something very, um...

878
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:40,004
How can I describe it? ..lonely..

879
00:45:41,764 --> 00:45:43,403
..about Doom.

880
00:45:43,404 --> 00:45:47,003
I know, it's not a shock for some
people to imagine computer players,

881
00:45:47,004 --> 00:45:49,123
computer game players
as being lonely,

882
00:45:49,124 --> 00:45:52,603
but Doom was one of those games
I used to dream about, you know.

883
00:45:52,604 --> 00:45:56,604
There was a feeling of real isolation
to it, you know, and, er,

884
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:58,923
I found that quite powerful at times.

885
00:45:58,924 --> 00:46:02,924
Isolation is scary. Doom was scary.
Very scary! Honestly!

886
00:46:04,764 --> 00:46:07,843
Young people hearing
older people talk about...

887
00:46:07,844 --> 00:46:11,844
how Doom was scary must be like, you
know when you read those stories how

888
00:46:12,324 --> 00:46:14,963
when people saw the first cinema
and would see a train coming,

889
00:46:14,964 --> 00:46:17,363
and they would run out of
the cinema, you know what I mean,

890
00:46:17,364 --> 00:46:19,883
you hear those stories and
laugh and think, "These idiots!

891
00:46:19,884 --> 00:46:21,723
"They thought
it was a real train coming!"

892
00:46:21,724 --> 00:46:24,323
But you know, things can have
an incredible effect on you,

893
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:26,123
when you're first experiencing them.

894
00:46:26,124 --> 00:46:28,643
The reason why Doom was
terrifying for me was

895
00:46:28,644 --> 00:46:31,843
because there were doors in it
that could open and shut.

896
00:46:31,844 --> 00:46:35,443
That, you know, seems like caveman
staff, like being scared of that,

897
00:46:35,444 --> 00:46:38,083
like, "Eugh!" being scared
of a shadow or something,

898
00:46:38,084 --> 00:46:39,843
but the fact that there were doors,

899
00:46:39,844 --> 00:46:42,043
and you could hear things
behind the doors,

900
00:46:42,044 --> 00:46:44,403
that was an incredible
kind of leap forward,

901
00:46:44,404 --> 00:46:47,084
that was an incredible,
um, an incredible thing!

902
00:46:49,364 --> 00:46:52,283
One of the things
that makes Doom scary is just,

903
00:46:52,284 --> 00:46:55,283
obviously, the darkness in the game

904
00:46:55,284 --> 00:46:58,483
and it's also scary in that,
um, enemies,

905
00:46:58,484 --> 00:47:02,403
you can hear them wandering around,
so you know they're there somewhere

906
00:47:02,404 --> 00:47:05,963
and just hearing that,
not seeing it, is a scary thing.

907
00:47:05,964 --> 00:47:08,443
And also, you know that
you could go through a hallway

908
00:47:08,444 --> 00:47:11,403
and accidentally step on the
wrong thing and, all of a sudden,

909
00:47:11,404 --> 00:47:14,123
a wall opens up next to you
and stuff is coming out at you.

910
00:47:14,124 --> 00:47:15,963
Doom was packed with
so many innovations,

911
00:47:15,964 --> 00:47:18,683
it was almost embarrassing,
but its biggest innovation of all

912
00:47:18,684 --> 00:47:22,684
was the immersive
and compelling multiplayer mode.

913
00:47:22,764 --> 00:47:25,843
I can remember, I was actually
working at a game development studio,

914
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:28,443
and one day we all went in
one Saturday, we all went in

915
00:47:28,444 --> 00:47:31,443
and set up the computers, um,
set up the local area networks,

916
00:47:31,444 --> 00:47:33,323
that we could all play Doom together,

917
00:47:33,324 --> 00:47:36,483
and it was my first experience
of being in a game world with

918
00:47:36,484 --> 00:47:40,203
a whole bunch of friends playing
together, beating enemies, er...

919
00:47:40,204 --> 00:47:43,323
and being aware of each other,
that whole idea of telepresence,

920
00:47:43,324 --> 00:47:46,283
being aware of each other in
a game world, it was fascinating

921
00:47:46,284 --> 00:47:49,363
and so, so compelling and we just
played for 12 hours straight.

922
00:47:49,364 --> 00:47:52,483
The beauty of video games
is that it, um,

923
00:47:52,484 --> 00:47:56,484
it adds... it adds a dimension to
friendship that nothing else does.

924
00:47:57,044 --> 00:47:59,723
Going to see a film with your friends
is nothing compared

925
00:47:59,724 --> 00:48:02,243
to being in a shoot 'em up
or a game with your friends

926
00:48:02,244 --> 00:48:05,443
and Doom was the first game that
really allowed us to experience that.

927
00:48:05,444 --> 00:48:07,883
Yeah, although it's hard not to
notice that experience is

928
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:11,884
kind of violent and, in this regard,
Doom was a child of its time.

929
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:17,524
By 1993, technology had improved to
the point where in-game characters

930
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:20,683
could be represented,
albeit crudely, by real people,

931
00:48:20,684 --> 00:48:23,043
as in the notorious
Mortal Kombat here,

932
00:48:23,044 --> 00:48:24,643
And the sight of
these "real" people

933
00:48:24,644 --> 00:48:28,644
maiming and mutilating each other
was a step too far, for some.

934
00:48:29,004 --> 00:48:32,683
When a player wins, the so-called
"death sequence" begins.

935
00:48:32,684 --> 00:48:35,643
The game narrator instructs
the player "to finish...",

936
00:48:35,644 --> 00:48:37,963
and I quote, "finish his opponent."

937
00:48:37,964 --> 00:48:41,643
The player may then choose
a method of murder, ranging from

938
00:48:41,644 --> 00:48:45,644
ripping a heart out, to pulling
off the head of the opponent

939
00:48:46,044 --> 00:48:48,003
with spinal-cord attached.

940
00:48:48,004 --> 00:48:51,203
Every generation seems to have
some sort of cultural moral panic,

941
00:48:51,204 --> 00:48:53,603
whether it's, you know,
Elvis Presley's hips

942
00:48:53,604 --> 00:48:56,923
or video nasties or whatever, then,
in the '90s, it was video games.

943
00:48:56,924 --> 00:49:00,003
It was games like Doom,
you know, and Mortal Kombat,

944
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:03,643
that had what were perceived
to be super gory terrible graphics

945
00:49:03,644 --> 00:49:06,923
which, when you look at them now, is
ludicrous, cos, of course, it's just

946
00:49:06,924 --> 00:49:09,643
basically like people made
out of Ceefax getting blown up.

947
00:49:09,644 --> 00:49:12,683
Just as controversial was
the frankly crappy Night Trap,

948
00:49:12,684 --> 00:49:14,843
which came on the exciting
new CD-ROM format,

949
00:49:14,844 --> 00:49:18,844
threatening to turn games
into full-motion video nasties.

950
00:49:25,244 --> 00:49:28,403
Five teenage girls have disappeared,
after spending the night

951
00:49:28,404 --> 00:49:31,923
at the old Lakeshore winery house
of Mr and Mrs Victor Martin.

952
00:49:31,924 --> 00:49:34,483
It's like a television programme
in a lot of ways

953
00:49:34,484 --> 00:49:37,283
and the purpose is
you're part of a crack team

954
00:49:37,284 --> 00:49:40,403
that's protecting some girls
on a slumber party.

955
00:49:40,404 --> 00:49:43,723
So the gameplay is, basically,
clicking on the CCTV cameras

956
00:49:43,724 --> 00:49:47,163
and setting traps for these kind of
vampire things that are coming in.

957
00:49:47,164 --> 00:49:50,243
And, because it's video
and not graphics,

958
00:49:50,244 --> 00:49:52,843
and especially at the time
I think, it was life-like,

959
00:49:52,844 --> 00:49:55,803
because it wasn't the clunky
graphics of the '80s,

960
00:49:55,804 --> 00:49:58,483
- this was film you are watching.
- What are you doing?!

961
00:49:58,484 --> 00:50:01,163
And it is quite disturbing
to watch it, actually,

962
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,603
because it does feel
very voyeuristic.

963
00:50:03,604 --> 00:50:06,643
I understand why
it was controversial, um,

964
00:50:06,644 --> 00:50:07,963
because even today,

965
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:10,963
if you made a game today
where the concept was spying on,

966
00:50:10,964 --> 00:50:13,363
you know, college girls
in their lingerie,

967
00:50:13,364 --> 00:50:15,083
via various security cameras,

968
00:50:15,084 --> 00:50:17,563
and kind of stalking them
around this house,

969
00:50:17,564 --> 00:50:20,243
that would be
very controversial now! Back then,

970
00:50:20,244 --> 00:50:23,203
I can understand why people had
the reaction that they did.

971
00:50:23,204 --> 00:50:26,803
It has been... quite a leap

972
00:50:26,804 --> 00:50:29,563
from Pac-Man to Night Trap.

973
00:50:29,564 --> 00:50:32,843
Night Trap, which, just to be clear,
was a deeply shit game,

974
00:50:32,844 --> 00:50:35,003
was such a hot potato,
it featured heavily

975
00:50:35,004 --> 00:50:37,363
in a US Senate hearing
on video game violence,

976
00:50:37,364 --> 00:50:40,523
which led to Toys "R" Us
taking it off the shelves.

977
00:50:40,524 --> 00:50:42,203
Mortal Kombat and Night Trap

978
00:50:42,204 --> 00:50:46,163
are not the kind of gifts
that responsible parents give.

979
00:50:46,164 --> 00:50:49,083
Night Trap, which adds
a new dimension of violence,

980
00:50:49,084 --> 00:50:53,084
specifically targeted against women,
is especially repugnant.

981
00:50:53,204 --> 00:50:55,083
Significantly,
it led to the creation of

982
00:50:55,084 --> 00:50:56,643
the US video game ratings system,

983
00:50:56,644 --> 00:50:59,163
a voluntary code designed
to alert parents to content

984
00:50:59,164 --> 00:51:01,883
that might be unsuitable
for their disgusting children!

985
00:51:01,884 --> 00:51:03,163
This had a twofold effect.

986
00:51:03,164 --> 00:51:06,523
On the one hand, the games industry
was aware it was being watched.

987
00:51:06,524 --> 00:51:07,603
But on the other hand,

988
00:51:07,604 --> 00:51:10,363
the introduction of ratings
meant that games could now be

989
00:51:10,364 --> 00:51:14,364
conceived and marketed
explicitly as not for children.

990
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,323
Suddenly, developers
had a green light

991
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:18,203
to pursue nasty games
for nasty adults,

992
00:51:18,204 --> 00:51:19,843
leading to further controversy,

993
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:23,083
with the death-packed
pedestrian-splattering Carmageddon

994
00:51:23,084 --> 00:51:25,123
being briefly banned
in the UK in 1997

995
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:29,124
and the MP-alarming Grand Theft Auto
making its debut that same year.

996
00:51:29,164 --> 00:51:32,043
Lots of people at that time,
moral campaigners were trying

997
00:51:32,044 --> 00:51:34,483
to link video game violence
with real-life violence

998
00:51:34,484 --> 00:51:38,403
and we saw this later on
with, um, the Columbine tragedy,

999
00:51:38,404 --> 00:51:40,843
which lots of people
tried to suggest that

1000
00:51:40,844 --> 00:51:44,363
the two kids that were involved
in this were heavy games players.

1001
00:51:44,364 --> 00:51:47,163
Every time there's any
sort of violent act in the news,

1002
00:51:47,164 --> 00:51:50,963
it's always reported like,
"And the shooter was a big fan of,"

1003
00:51:50,964 --> 00:51:53,683
you know, "Grand Theft Auto
or Call Of Duty."

1004
00:51:53,684 --> 00:51:56,363
It's like, well, that's
because he's an 18-35-year-old man.

1005
00:51:56,364 --> 00:51:59,483
That's probably why he's a fan,
not because he's a psychopath!

1006
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:02,163
Recently, in the USA,
the National Rifle Association

1007
00:52:02,164 --> 00:52:05,163
has tried to shift blame for
a spate of mass shootings away from

1008
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:08,603
the availability of firearms and
onto the shoulders of video games.

1009
00:52:08,604 --> 00:52:12,604
Through vicious, violent video games,

1010
00:52:12,884 --> 00:52:15,603
with names like Bulletstorm...

1011
00:52:15,604 --> 00:52:17,923
Grand Theft Auto,

1012
00:52:17,924 --> 00:52:19,843
Mortal Kombat,

1013
00:52:19,844 --> 00:52:21,923
and Splatterhouse!

1014
00:52:21,924 --> 00:52:24,803
Ironically, the NRA make
some crude target shooting

1015
00:52:24,804 --> 00:52:27,123
and varmint hunting
games of their own.

1016
00:52:27,124 --> 00:52:29,283
Furthermore, not everyone is

1017
00:52:29,284 --> 00:52:32,163
convinced of a link between
violent games and violent behaviour.

1018
00:52:32,164 --> 00:52:35,323
I think there might be violent people
that play these video games,

1019
00:52:35,324 --> 00:52:38,643
but I don't think these video games
turn you into violent people.

1020
00:52:38,644 --> 00:52:40,403
We should move on.
We should talk about

1021
00:52:40,404 --> 00:52:42,443
some of the positive aspects
of video games

1022
00:52:42,444 --> 00:52:45,563
or some of the genuine challenges
we can make to the industry,

1023
00:52:45,564 --> 00:52:48,683
like where are the positive,
er, female role models in games?

1024
00:52:48,684 --> 00:52:50,803
But you know, if we carry on
with this debate...

1025
00:52:50,804 --> 00:52:52,803
It amazes me that
it's lasted me for so long.

1026
00:52:52,804 --> 00:52:56,163
Dedicated gamers tend to reflexively
scoff at any suggestion

1027
00:52:56,164 --> 00:52:57,403
games might be too violent,

1028
00:52:57,404 --> 00:53:00,003
but it's clear that even the most
hard-core splatter movies

1029
00:53:00,004 --> 00:53:02,003
don't dwell on
biological destruction

1030
00:53:02,004 --> 00:53:05,043
to quite the same gleeful degree
as many games do.

1031
00:53:05,044 --> 00:53:08,323
Increasing graphical fidelity means
the debate will intensify,

1032
00:53:08,324 --> 00:53:10,203
as the portrayal of violence does.

1033
00:53:10,204 --> 00:53:13,283
It's easy to laugh
at the low-tech depiction of death

1034
00:53:13,284 --> 00:53:16,643
in the early Mortal Kombat games,
but the recent Mortal Kombat 9

1035
00:53:16,644 --> 00:53:18,963
features extreme
and upsetting imagery

1036
00:53:18,964 --> 00:53:22,964
that would be almost entirely
unthinkable in most other mediums.

1037
00:53:31,244 --> 00:53:33,123
Despite scenes that shocking,

1038
00:53:33,124 --> 00:53:36,123
Mortal Kombat 9 failed to
generate any real controversy,

1039
00:53:36,124 --> 00:53:39,363
but then, many games still fly
somehow under the cultural radar

1040
00:53:39,364 --> 00:53:42,603
and, consequently, aren't
called upon to justify themselves.

1041
00:53:42,604 --> 00:53:45,763
I'm traditionally quite nonchalant
about violence in video games.

1042
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,763
I played the shit out of things
like Doom and Sniper Elite,

1043
00:53:48,764 --> 00:53:52,043
but even I find that
basically unacceptable,

1044
00:53:52,044 --> 00:53:55,683
which either means I've become
a terrible wuss in my old age

1045
00:53:55,684 --> 00:53:58,483
or games are becoming
so forensically graphic,

1046
00:53:58,484 --> 00:54:00,203
they're reaching a tipping point.

1047
00:54:00,204 --> 00:54:02,203
Some games have a more mature

1048
00:54:02,204 --> 00:54:05,363
and responsible attitude to
depicting violence than others.

1049
00:54:05,364 --> 00:54:07,483
Some are outright irresponsible.

1050
00:54:07,484 --> 00:54:10,643
Others, I think, do it in a much
more mature and responsible way.

1051
00:54:10,644 --> 00:54:13,283
And so, um, I don't think
there's anything inherently bad

1052
00:54:13,284 --> 00:54:16,603
about expressing or exploring the
subjects of violence in video games,

1053
00:54:16,604 --> 00:54:20,123
just as there is in any medium, but
there is violence in the real world,

1054
00:54:20,124 --> 00:54:22,003
there will be violence in
any artistic, er,

1055
00:54:22,004 --> 00:54:26,004
reflection of the real world,
and video games are no different.

1056
00:54:26,524 --> 00:54:29,723
And when women in games aren't
being gruesomely sawn in half,

1057
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:33,724
they're often being simplified,
patronised and objectified.

1058
00:54:36,044 --> 00:54:38,283
But the games industry's
treatment of what

1059
00:54:38,284 --> 00:54:40,843
I tactfully won't refer to
as "the titted gender"

1060
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:47,964
was about to be challenged,
as we'll see after this break.

1061
00:54:51,684 --> 00:54:53,203
Picture the scene.

1062
00:54:53,204 --> 00:54:57,163
It's the mid-1990s and no-one knows what to
make of humankind's poxy existence any more

1063
00:54:57,164 --> 00:55:01,043
because OJ Simpson has just left
court an entirely innocent man.

1064
00:55:01,044 --> 00:55:04,243
Barings Bank has collapsed thanks to
rogue trader Nick Leeson

1065
00:55:04,244 --> 00:55:07,603
and in the world of pop,
middle-class Kinks fans Blur

1066
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:11,123
are going head to head with dirge-spewing
musical chimps' tea-party Oasis

1067
00:55:11,124 --> 00:55:14,763
in a battle literally no-one gave
a shit about, even at the time.

1068
00:55:14,764 --> 00:55:18,123
Meanwhile, bruised by the beating
it took over flogging violent

1069
00:55:18,124 --> 00:55:22,043
games to kids, the games industry
suddenly hit on a new target market.

1070
00:55:22,044 --> 00:55:24,603
People off their faces on ecstasy,

1071
00:55:24,604 --> 00:55:27,803
or clubbers as
they are technically known.

1072
00:55:27,804 --> 00:55:31,763
Have you seen any drug-taking? Aye!

1073
00:55:31,764 --> 00:55:35,764
Did you take any yourself?

1074
00:55:37,204 --> 00:55:41,204
Here we have a normal, healthy young
man and here we have a fellow

1075
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:45,323
who has been experimenting with
PlayStation for only a few minutes.

1076
00:55:45,324 --> 00:55:47,763
Enter the slickly marketed
PlayStation,

1077
00:55:47,764 --> 00:55:51,764
positioned as the post-club,
post-spliff entertainment medium of choice,

1078
00:55:51,804 --> 00:55:55,804
bristling with trippy visuals
and incredible soundtracks.

1079
00:55:58,204 --> 00:56:00,003
PlayStation moved gaming on

1080
00:56:00,004 --> 00:56:01,683
and gaming was now something that

1081
00:56:01,684 --> 00:56:03,363
young adults did, not just men.

1082
00:56:03,364 --> 00:56:07,364
Lots of woman played Wipeout, lots of
women played early PlayStation games.

1083
00:56:07,484 --> 00:56:11,484
They understood there was something
powerful about putting a woman on screen.

1084
00:56:17,284 --> 00:56:19,843
Tomb Raider was the first game
I became obsessed with.

1085
00:56:19,844 --> 00:56:23,844
It was the only game at the time
where there was a woman involved,

1086
00:56:24,604 --> 00:56:28,604
and a woman with a couple of guns
shooting stuff and being really kick ass.

1087
00:56:29,604 --> 00:56:33,604
Partly inspired by the gutsy female
image of singer Neneh Cherry

1088
00:56:33,684 --> 00:56:37,443
and post-punk toon feminist
Tank Girl, Tomb Raider's Lara Croft

1089
00:56:37,444 --> 00:56:41,203
earns a place on our list for being
gaming's first true female icon.

1090
00:56:41,204 --> 00:56:44,163
This was the era of Loaded and FHM,

1091
00:56:44,164 --> 00:56:48,123
and Lara Croft somehow was the
virtual representation

1092
00:56:48,124 --> 00:56:49,563
of that whole idea,

1093
00:56:49,564 --> 00:56:53,443
she was a sexy Mario,
the sexy sonic.

1094
00:56:53,444 --> 00:56:55,843
There has been
so much discussion about

1095
00:56:55,844 --> 00:56:58,723
was she an object of female
empowerment

1096
00:56:58,724 --> 00:57:01,123
or an object of male titillation?

1097
00:57:01,124 --> 00:57:05,124
When I was ten years old playing
that game, that didn't matter to me,

1098
00:57:05,364 --> 00:57:09,364
all I saw was a woman where
previously I had only seen a man,

1099
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:11,803
and that was huge for me.

1100
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:15,123
Having ruled the late '90s,
brightening up trendy magazine covers

1101
00:57:15,124 --> 00:57:17,403
and appearing in irreverent
soft drinks ads,

1102
00:57:17,404 --> 00:57:20,883
the 2000s would be less kind to
Lara, despite, or perhaps because

1103
00:57:20,884 --> 00:57:23,843
of, being trained by the equally
unrealistic Angelina Jolie

1104
00:57:23,844 --> 00:57:26,563
in a pair of noisy but not very good
Hollywood action flicks.

1105
00:57:26,564 --> 00:57:27,483
Stop!

1106
00:57:27,484 --> 00:57:30,843
But then in 2013, Tomb Raider was
rebooted and re-imagined

1107
00:57:30,844 --> 00:57:34,844
with an increased emphasis on story
and Lara's character.

1108
00:57:35,364 --> 00:57:39,364
I have finally set out to
make my mark. To find adventure.

1109
00:57:40,404 --> 00:57:44,404
Another key difference - this time
the lead writer was female.

1110
00:57:44,764 --> 00:57:48,683
I didn't like the way she had been
adopted by the wider media

1111
00:57:48,684 --> 00:57:52,684
and over-sexualised, and I felt
that as a younger female gamer

1112
00:57:53,204 --> 00:57:55,923
I was being pushed
away from the franchise.

1113
00:57:55,924 --> 00:57:59,323
When I took on the role of helping
develop this new, younger Lara,

1114
00:57:59,324 --> 00:58:03,324
I really thought about what
myself as a gamer when I started out

1115
00:58:04,164 --> 00:58:08,164
would have liked and what the younger
me would have responded well to.

1116
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:12,443
You can look at the journey
of video games

1117
00:58:12,444 --> 00:58:15,523
and mirror it with the journey
of Lara Croft as a character.

1118
00:58:15,524 --> 00:58:18,483
At the beginning she was a look,
because video games were

1119
00:58:18,484 --> 00:58:21,963
mostly about looks, and then as time
has gone on, Lara's creators

1120
00:58:21,964 --> 00:58:25,083
have made her more of a character,
more of a relatable person.

1121
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:29,084
Similarly, all video games have been trying to
tell stories that are more human, more relatable.

1122
00:58:29,284 --> 00:58:31,243
The new Tomb Raider
reboot feeds into that.

1123
00:58:31,244 --> 00:58:34,483
What you have there is a character
who was once an avatar

1124
00:58:34,484 --> 00:58:36,163
and is now becoming a person.

1125
00:58:36,164 --> 00:58:40,163
This shift reflected a debate
about gaming's depiction of women

1126
00:58:40,164 --> 00:58:41,923
that was already well underway.

1127
00:58:41,924 --> 00:58:45,043
In many ways, games still seem
psychologically lodged

1128
00:58:45,044 --> 00:58:46,283
somewhere around 1978,

1129
00:58:46,284 --> 00:58:49,243
full of eye candy dolly birds
without much to say for themselves

1130
00:58:49,244 --> 00:58:51,803
and the voices questioning this
have been growing louder.

1131
00:58:51,804 --> 00:58:54,523
In 2012, when cultural critic

1132
00:58:54,524 --> 00:58:57,323
Anita Sarkeesian launched a
Kickstarter campaign to fund

1133
00:58:57,324 --> 00:59:01,003
a series of short films about female
stereotypes in games,

1134
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:05,004
some male gamers reacted by bombarding
her with rape and death threats.

1135
00:59:05,244 --> 00:59:07,123
I don't believe video
gamers are sexist.

1136
00:59:07,124 --> 00:59:10,363
I don't believe most
games are sexist.

1137
00:59:10,364 --> 00:59:13,403
But also, you look at video games
and you can't deny that there are

1138
00:59:13,404 --> 00:59:15,883
things in there that are not
flattering to women and

1139
00:59:15,884 --> 00:59:19,163
make you roll your eyes and sigh, or
sometimes make you really angry.

1140
00:59:19,164 --> 00:59:21,363
I think it is not so much
gaming culture

1141
00:59:21,364 --> 00:59:24,443
that is unfriendly to women,
it is internet culture.

1142
00:59:24,444 --> 00:59:27,443
Even today, a huge number of games
still place you,

1143
00:59:27,444 --> 00:59:30,523
the player, in the shoes of a boring
cookie-cutter Caucasian

1144
00:59:30,524 --> 00:59:34,524
hetero dude with a dick and a gun,
and fuck all else of interest.

1145
00:59:35,124 --> 00:59:37,083
But there are some exceptions.

1146
00:59:37,084 --> 00:59:41,084
Mass Effect is a good
example of a mainstream video game,

1147
00:59:41,204 --> 00:59:44,003
one that many people buy, that does
include something other than

1148
00:59:44,004 --> 00:59:46,523
straight white men and for that
reason it has a very devoted

1149
00:59:46,524 --> 00:59:49,763
following among people who are not
necessarily straight white men.

1150
00:59:49,764 --> 00:59:52,723
In Mass Effect, your character is
basically bisexual by default,

1151
00:59:52,724 --> 00:59:54,283
you can fight with whoever you want

1152
00:59:54,284 --> 00:59:57,003
and pursue a relationship with
whoever you want and it is sad

1153
00:59:57,004 --> 01:00:01,004
that this is progressive but in a
video game of this size it is progressive.

1154
01:00:01,524 --> 01:00:04,523
I did not know you were such
an optimist.

1155
01:00:04,524 --> 01:00:07,683
You have that effect on people.

1156
01:00:07,684 --> 01:00:11,403
Meanwhile, back in the late 1990s,
those cool adult gamers were not content

1157
01:00:11,404 --> 01:00:15,404
to experiment with things like
female protagonists such as Lara Croft,

1158
01:00:15,724 --> 01:00:17,683
they wanted whole new
kinds of experience.

1159
01:00:17,684 --> 01:00:21,603
Games had become set in their ways,
there were too many predictable

1160
01:00:21,604 --> 01:00:25,604
platformers or metronomic fighting
games or by-the-book shoot-'em-ups.

1161
01:00:26,564 --> 01:00:29,763
What was required was an entirely
new kind of experiences,

1162
01:00:29,764 --> 01:00:31,523
a new kind of game.

1163
01:00:31,524 --> 01:00:35,524
And that is precisely what turned
up. Winning a bobble head.

1164
01:00:42,844 --> 01:00:45,283
PaRappa The Rapper is a game about
a musical dog

1165
01:00:45,284 --> 01:00:49,284
who learns the value of self belief
by rapping with a kung-fu onion

1166
01:00:50,764 --> 01:00:54,764
while you just press
buttons along with the beat.

1167
01:00:57,724 --> 01:01:00,043
PaRappa The Rapper was incredible.

1168
01:01:00,044 --> 01:01:02,603
Such a simple, really clever
use of the controller,

1169
01:01:02,604 --> 01:01:04,403
you had to hit the things
in sequence.

1170
01:01:04,404 --> 01:01:07,483
The first time I remember the
"boom-boom-ba, boom-boom-ba".

1171
01:01:07,484 --> 01:01:11,123
That very simple Simon says
kind of gameplay.

1172
01:01:11,124 --> 01:01:14,123
Simon sets the pace,
you follow right along.

1173
01:01:14,124 --> 01:01:17,403
Simon says style rhythm action games
began with the endearingly

1174
01:01:17,404 --> 01:01:19,443
advertised computer
smart arse Simon.

1175
01:01:19,444 --> 01:01:20,883
Simon has a brain,

1176
01:01:20,884 --> 01:01:24,883
you either do what Simon says
or else go down the drain.

1177
01:01:24,884 --> 01:01:27,203
PaRappa turned this basic concept

1178
01:01:27,204 --> 01:01:31,204
into a psychedelic
musical pop-up book.

1179
01:01:31,244 --> 01:01:35,244
The songs are...
they are so catchy and insane.

1180
01:01:49,564 --> 01:01:53,564
I often listen to
the onion man song.

1181
01:01:57,164 --> 01:02:01,164
The driving school one.

1182
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:06,844
There's the one where they are all
waiting to go to the toilet.

1183
01:02:11,924 --> 01:02:14,643
There's the driving school one,
did I say that? Yes.

1184
01:02:14,644 --> 01:02:18,283
PaRappa The Rapper was appealing
because it made people like me

1185
01:02:18,284 --> 01:02:21,123
who have absolutely no musical
ability whatsoever

1186
01:02:21,124 --> 01:02:24,083
feel like they did.

1187
01:02:24,084 --> 01:02:26,243
That was a big
part of the appeal,

1188
01:02:26,244 --> 01:02:28,683
the fact that you
were pressing buttons in time.

1189
01:02:28,684 --> 01:02:30,683
There's no musical talent in that
whatsoever

1190
01:02:30,684 --> 01:02:32,123
but you felt that there was.

1191
01:02:32,124 --> 01:02:34,923
PaRappa The Rapper led to
games like Guitar Hero,

1192
01:02:34,924 --> 01:02:38,483
in which you use a simplified
push-button guitar to play along to

1193
01:02:38,484 --> 01:02:40,723
recognisable
hits from big-name acts.

1194
01:02:40,724 --> 01:02:43,963
Later games added far more
realistic instruments, meaning

1195
01:02:43,964 --> 01:02:46,203
players would generally
improve their skills,

1196
01:02:46,204 --> 01:02:50,204
however old they were, as you
can see from this charming footage.

1197
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:57,483
The very latest rhythm games have
taken this to the logical

1198
01:02:57,484 --> 01:03:01,283
conclusion. You now connect a real
guitar directly to your console.

1199
01:03:01,284 --> 01:03:03,563
In fact, they are not
marketed as games any more

1200
01:03:03,564 --> 01:03:06,443
but bona fide
musical education tools.

1201
01:03:06,444 --> 01:03:08,883
Not a bad legacy for a cartoon dog
in a hat, although

1202
01:03:08,884 --> 01:03:10,483
PaRappa himself has been forgotten,

1203
01:03:10,484 --> 01:03:14,484
relegated to appearing alongside 50 Cent as a
pop culture reference in subversive comedy shows.

1204
01:03:15,404 --> 01:03:17,283
# Kickin' and punchin' and blockin'

1205
01:03:17,284 --> 01:03:20,003
# Blockin' and kickin' all night

1206
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:22,243
# Blockin' and kickin'
and turn around

1207
01:03:22,244 --> 01:03:24,803
# We'll be punching everything
in sight. #

1208
01:03:24,804 --> 01:03:28,804
PaRappa, you never return my phone
calls so now eat bullets, and lick my balls.

1209
01:03:31,004 --> 01:03:35,004
It is a rarity talking about games
on TV. TV doesn't often "do" games

1210
01:03:35,084 --> 01:03:38,243
and one of the key reasons for
that is that TV commissioners believe that

1211
01:03:38,244 --> 01:03:41,283
no-one wants to watch other people
playing them, which is a valid point.

1212
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:44,963
Picture two dweebs playing some
baffling point-and-click strategy game,

1213
01:03:44,964 --> 01:03:48,964
it is not like anyone is going to
pack out a stadium to see that.

1214
01:03:51,564 --> 01:03:55,564
This illuminating documentary
footage depicts emotional South Korean fans

1215
01:03:56,444 --> 01:03:59,883
watching their idols in action.
Who are their idols?

1216
01:03:59,884 --> 01:04:03,763
These guys.
Shit-hot Starcraft players.

1217
01:04:03,764 --> 01:04:07,764
The Koreans are quite into
Starcraft.

1218
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:15,764
A densely complex war sim, Starcraft is
basically fast-paced space chess.

1219
01:04:17,724 --> 01:04:20,483
Starcraft is a real-time strategy
game,

1220
01:04:20,484 --> 01:04:23,403
building a base
and sending soldiers to kill people

1221
01:04:23,404 --> 01:04:27,404
but at a pace that will
take whole years off your life.

1222
01:04:27,884 --> 01:04:31,884
Starcraft is interesting in that
it has emerged as the first

1223
01:04:31,924 --> 01:04:35,924
sort of competitive sport of gaming.

1224
01:04:35,964 --> 01:04:38,643
If you look at Korea, for example,

1225
01:04:38,644 --> 01:04:40,963
Starcraft is effectively
the national sport.

1226
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:43,723
There are cable television channels
dedicated to Starcraft.

1227
01:04:43,724 --> 01:04:46,843
The key Starcraft pro players in
Korea are superstars,

1228
01:04:46,844 --> 01:04:50,283
they have fans, screaming adulation.

1229
01:04:50,284 --> 01:04:52,243
As you can see it evokes
unparalleled

1230
01:04:52,244 --> 01:04:54,164
excitement among commentators.

1231
01:04:57,364 --> 01:05:00,603
For a lot of people, they just
enjoy watching people that are

1232
01:05:00,604 --> 01:05:04,604
good at things. It is almost like
watching a virtuoso piano playing.

1233
01:05:04,764 --> 01:05:08,403
When you watch these guys playing
Starcraft, their fingers are a blur,

1234
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,523
and it is kind of fascinating.

1235
01:05:10,524 --> 01:05:12,563
Never mind fascinating,

1236
01:05:12,564 --> 01:05:15,604
the Korean audience finds the game
shout-out-loud shit-ifying.

1237
01:05:22,124 --> 01:05:26,124
Shortly afterwards, the year 2000
arrived in a flurry of optimistic fireworks

1238
01:05:26,884 --> 01:05:29,763
and humankind wondered what majesty
the new century would behold.

1239
01:05:29,764 --> 01:05:32,323
It turned out the answer was
a voyeuristic reality show in

1240
01:05:32,324 --> 01:05:36,324
which egotists entertained the nation
by sharing a bog for six weeks.

1241
01:05:36,364 --> 01:05:40,364
They weren't the only housemates
entrancing millions.

1242
01:05:46,884 --> 01:05:50,884
The Sims in some sense is a life
simulator where you create little people,

1243
01:05:51,444 --> 01:05:54,683
personalities, they then
live their lives in the game.

1244
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:58,323
You can create houses for them,
they can get jobs, fall in love, have kids.

1245
01:05:58,324 --> 01:06:01,523
Following in the footsteps of the
voyeuristic satire The Truman Show,

1246
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:05,443
in which the world tuned in to watch
the mundanity of a suburban life,

1247
01:06:05,444 --> 01:06:08,563
The Sims tapped into our desire for
a perfect domestic existence.

1248
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:11,963
It appeals to that part of you that
wants to escape into another

1249
01:06:11,964 --> 01:06:14,523
world and create another
version of yourself,

1250
01:06:14,524 --> 01:06:18,243
almost too similar to
what your real life is.

1251
01:06:18,244 --> 01:06:20,163
I was living on my own

1252
01:06:20,164 --> 01:06:24,164
when I first played The Sims and
I didn't really go for it.

1253
01:06:24,244 --> 01:06:27,643
I just could not see the point.

1254
01:06:27,644 --> 01:06:31,644
But I was playing it and it was in
the early stages of the game when you

1255
01:06:32,044 --> 01:06:36,044
buy a flat and I noticed there were
these little green patches on the floor

1256
01:06:36,164 --> 01:06:40,164
and the sound of flies near them.
I was like, "What are these?"

1257
01:06:40,724 --> 01:06:44,724
As the game progressed, more of
these would build up.

1258
01:06:45,444 --> 01:06:48,283
I thought, "How do I get rid of
them?"

1259
01:06:48,284 --> 01:06:51,363
I figured it out that it was
wastepaper bins.

1260
01:06:51,364 --> 01:06:53,683
You put wastepaper bins in each room

1261
01:06:53,684 --> 01:06:56,363
and those little green things
stop appearing.

1262
01:06:56,364 --> 01:06:57,643
I was playing the game

1263
01:06:57,644 --> 01:07:01,644
and I thought, "Maybe I should put
wastepaper bins in my flat."

1264
01:07:02,364 --> 01:07:05,363
The Sims wasn't just idle play,
it was stressful.

1265
01:07:05,364 --> 01:07:08,203
You have to micro-manage every
aspect of your Sims' existence,

1266
01:07:08,204 --> 01:07:11,523
from how many bins they had, to how
often they went to the toilet.

1267
01:07:11,524 --> 01:07:14,323
You had to eat healthily,
exercise loads

1268
01:07:14,324 --> 01:07:16,603
and generally behave
if you wanted a good life

1269
01:07:16,604 --> 01:07:20,523
and that good life was rigidly
defined as a well-paid job,

1270
01:07:20,524 --> 01:07:24,123
a smiling partner and a tidy house
full of possessions.

1271
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:26,883
Maintaining all of that became
increasingly difficult.

1272
01:07:26,884 --> 01:07:28,963
It took the American suburban dream

1273
01:07:28,964 --> 01:07:32,403
and turned it into an endless
point-and-click pain in the arse.

1274
01:07:32,404 --> 01:07:34,963
It was meant to be
a satire of US culture

1275
01:07:34,964 --> 01:07:36,723
and most people didn't get that.

1276
01:07:36,724 --> 01:07:39,563
The promise of the game is that you
have all of these objects

1277
01:07:39,564 --> 01:07:41,763
and each one has little ratings.

1278
01:07:41,764 --> 01:07:45,764
Each object becomes a ticking time
bomb. They can break, they can

1279
01:07:48,044 --> 01:07:50,523
catch fire, become dysfunctional.

1280
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:54,524
You find out these objects you are buying to
make yourself happy are making you miserable.

1281
01:07:57,764 --> 01:08:01,403
Even though The Sims' roots lay in
satirising consumerism,

1282
01:08:01,404 --> 01:08:04,763
it soon became a capitalist cash cow
itself, with a barrage

1283
01:08:04,764 --> 01:08:08,603
of distinctly un-ironic branded
spin-off packs you had to pay for.

1284
01:08:08,604 --> 01:08:11,843
I don't think The Sims will ever
be as popular again as it was

1285
01:08:11,844 --> 01:08:14,043
when it was first released
and the reason why is

1286
01:08:14,044 --> 01:08:18,043
because we are The Sims now, really.
Each other are The Sims.

1287
01:08:18,044 --> 01:08:21,963
When you look at social networks
and Facebook, you now

1288
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:24,723
have that top-down
view into people's lives.

1289
01:08:24,724 --> 01:08:28,603
The Sims created a realistic world
but made you conform in it.

1290
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,603
Luckily a game was about
to come along

1291
01:08:30,604 --> 01:08:35,964
that would let you indulge
your darker side.

1292
01:08:38,964 --> 01:08:41,403
On September 11 2001,

1293
01:08:41,404 --> 01:08:44,763
millions feared the world
was about to slide into chaos.

1294
01:08:44,764 --> 01:08:48,323
Weeks later a video game consisting
almost entirely of nihilistic

1295
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:52,324
urban anarchy ushered in a new age
of morally blank freedom for gamers.

1296
01:08:58,844 --> 01:09:02,844
I love the feeling of
dropping in to what is

1297
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:08,283
a pretty realistic simulation
of a working city

1298
01:09:08,284 --> 01:09:12,003
and then just causing havoc.

1299
01:09:12,004 --> 01:09:14,763
It is just sort of
perfect escapism for me.

1300
01:09:14,764 --> 01:09:18,323
Early incarnations of Grand Theft
Auto were somewhat primitive

1301
01:09:18,324 --> 01:09:22,324
and looked vaguely reminiscent of the
rebellious bedroom-coded ZX Spectrum games

1302
01:09:22,444 --> 01:09:24,203
that were part of its genetic code.

1303
01:09:24,204 --> 01:09:27,043
Despite being set in
an exaggerated version of the USA,

1304
01:09:27,044 --> 01:09:31,044
it was a defiantly British game
made in Scotland from murders!

1305
01:09:32,924 --> 01:09:34,003
Grand Theft Auto

1306
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:35,563
arrived at DMA Design,

1307
01:09:35,564 --> 01:09:38,203
a small Scottish development team
in Dundee.

1308
01:09:38,204 --> 01:09:42,203
It was something their very small
team had worked on for four years

1309
01:09:42,204 --> 01:09:46,204
and it was thought of in the studio
as kind of the runt of the litter.

1310
01:09:49,884 --> 01:09:53,803
Then in came Sam and Dan Houser
who took on a publishing deal

1311
01:09:53,804 --> 01:09:54,963
with DMA Design.

1312
01:09:54,964 --> 01:09:58,523
They became kind of the producers
of the game and it changed.

1313
01:09:58,524 --> 01:10:00,563
So when Grand Theft Auto III
came out,

1314
01:10:00,564 --> 01:10:03,763
they used 3D visuals which made
the game feel more mature

1315
01:10:03,764 --> 01:10:07,163
but it was also much more aware
of wider cultural issues.

1316
01:10:07,164 --> 01:10:08,603
It had lots of cool music in it

1317
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,883
and again there was
a sense of anarchy to it

1318
01:10:10,884 --> 01:10:14,003
but it was more out of control
this time.

1319
01:10:14,004 --> 01:10:15,803
I'm only pretending to play that.

1320
01:10:15,804 --> 01:10:18,443
Grand Theft Auto III
was an immense blockbuster

1321
01:10:18,444 --> 01:10:20,923
revolutionising a franchise
that has become one of the most

1322
01:10:20,924 --> 01:10:23,723
lucrative entertainment properties
in history with an influence

1323
01:10:23,724 --> 01:10:25,483
that stretches
beyond the world of games.

1324
01:10:25,484 --> 01:10:26,963
If you watch the film Drive

1325
01:10:26,964 --> 01:10:29,043
with Ryan Gosling.

1326
01:10:29,044 --> 01:10:30,643
I do not believe that film

1327
01:10:30,644 --> 01:10:31,923
would look the way it does

1328
01:10:31,924 --> 01:10:33,683
if it wasn't for Grand Theft Auto.

1329
01:10:33,684 --> 01:10:37,283
Lots of people say the director
essentially made

1330
01:10:37,284 --> 01:10:39,763
a non-interactive
version of Grand Theft Auto.

1331
01:10:39,764 --> 01:10:43,764
The world of Drive as depicted
in that film is very much influenced

1332
01:10:45,284 --> 01:10:47,523
and inspired
by Grand Theft Auto, I think.

1333
01:10:47,524 --> 01:10:48,563
But unlike cinema,

1334
01:10:48,564 --> 01:10:51,123
most of the stories told
within the world of GTA

1335
01:10:51,124 --> 01:10:53,843
are ones the player
effectively writes themselves

1336
01:10:53,844 --> 01:10:56,003
using the freedom
of their own actions.

1337
01:10:56,004 --> 01:10:58,363
Don't be no wise-ass punk.
Now give me that!

1338
01:10:58,364 --> 01:11:00,243
The other day I stole a car,

1339
01:11:00,244 --> 01:11:03,443
I'm shooting someone in the head

1340
01:11:03,444 --> 01:11:06,483
and my wife was shouting
shoot him again, shoot him again.

1341
01:11:06,484 --> 01:11:10,484
Now, we are two very peaceable
cat-loving ladies from Glasgow.

1342
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:14,724
I think I can rationalise it because
I know it's not real, it's not real.

1343
01:11:14,884 --> 01:11:17,723
Yes, and if rib-tickling
viral videos are anything to go by,

1344
01:11:17,724 --> 01:11:19,483
GTA's world of fantasy indulgence

1345
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:21,443
even seems to appeal
to older players,

1346
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:24,723
especially those with an axe to
grind against energy companies.

1347
01:11:24,724 --> 01:11:27,203
You take that.
Hello, what do you do for a living?

1348
01:11:27,204 --> 01:11:30,443
Work for British Gas, do you?
You wanker.

1349
01:11:30,444 --> 01:11:33,483
I'll give you put my bills up.
Bastard bank! You take that.

1350
01:11:33,484 --> 01:11:37,403
You won't put them up no more.
Bang! One for you and one for you!

1351
01:11:37,404 --> 01:11:38,443
For some reason,

1352
01:11:38,444 --> 01:11:41,563
this level of anarchic freedom
seems to upset people.

1353
01:11:41,564 --> 01:11:45,564
Parents, listen up because here's
what you need to know tonight.

1354
01:11:47,684 --> 01:11:51,684
In Grand Theft Auto, your son
or your husband or your boyfriend

1355
01:11:52,284 --> 01:11:56,284
or whoever can hire a prostitute,
have sex with her

1356
01:11:56,764 --> 01:12:00,764
and then beat her to death
with a baseball bat.

1357
01:12:03,644 --> 01:12:06,923
GTA is the gift that
keeps on giving for tabloids.

1358
01:12:06,924 --> 01:12:09,083
I mean, Parliament debates it,

1359
01:12:09,084 --> 01:12:12,163
there are motions tabled
in the House of Commons on it,

1360
01:12:12,164 --> 01:12:14,323
there are endless commentators

1361
01:12:14,324 --> 01:12:17,563
who judge it to be something
linked to the devil.

1362
01:12:17,564 --> 01:12:21,323
If you're a parent and you allow
your son or daughter to watch this,

1363
01:12:21,324 --> 01:12:25,324
even if they are beyond 18 years old,
you're a lousy parent, in my opinion.

1364
01:12:26,444 --> 01:12:30,444
It is the definitive
moral panic game.

1365
01:12:31,484 --> 01:12:35,043
Please don't make me ruin all the great work
your plastic surgeons have been doing.

1366
01:12:35,044 --> 01:12:39,043
Grand Theft Auto is pretty much the
Frankie Boyle of the gaming world, really.

1367
01:12:39,044 --> 01:12:41,643
It's controversial,
Scottish, nihilistic,

1368
01:12:41,644 --> 01:12:44,443
hard to defend in the Guardian
and to what end?

1369
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:48,443
Well, because it just wants to
make you laugh, of course.

1370
01:12:48,444 --> 01:12:50,083
Yeah, shut it, pal.

1371
01:12:50,084 --> 01:12:53,163
You'll leave here with an asshole
like a yawning hippo's mouth.

1372
01:12:53,164 --> 01:12:55,723
It is interesting being a Brit
living in the United States.

1373
01:12:55,724 --> 01:12:58,803
People outside of America
tend to look at the American world

1374
01:12:58,804 --> 01:13:00,963
from the outside
a little more cynically.

1375
01:13:00,964 --> 01:13:04,323
We look at American culture
and American values with a little

1376
01:13:04,324 --> 01:13:07,123
bit more cynicism than
people inside America society do.

1377
01:13:07,124 --> 01:13:09,603
You have to be on the outside
to hold up a mirror

1378
01:13:09,604 --> 01:13:13,604
and that may be the reason GTA has
been fairly successful as a piece of satire.

1379
01:13:15,204 --> 01:13:16,803
Again, I think the satire,

1380
01:13:16,804 --> 01:13:19,123
the commentary in GTA,
is often very crass.

1381
01:13:19,124 --> 01:13:21,523
I think they miss the target
as often as they hit it but again,

1382
01:13:21,524 --> 01:13:24,563
the fact that they are trying
goes beyond a lot of what

1383
01:13:24,564 --> 01:13:27,363
a lot of triple-A big budget video
games ever try to do.

1384
01:13:27,364 --> 01:13:31,364
It's a giant cartoon, Grand Theft
Auto, and it's not exactly a subtle

1385
01:13:32,964 --> 01:13:36,403
representation of anything
but then it is not meant to be.

1386
01:13:36,404 --> 01:13:39,763
If you want a subtle representation
of something else,

1387
01:13:39,764 --> 01:13:42,123
read a lovely book by Jane Austen.

1388
01:13:42,124 --> 01:13:45,003
Grand Theft Auto is all about
causing mayhem and not giving

1389
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:48,323
a fig about the consequences
but increasingly some games

1390
01:13:48,324 --> 01:13:52,203
are prompting players to consider
the repercussions of their actions.

1391
01:13:52,204 --> 01:13:56,204
And they do it
with surprising grace.

1392
01:13:59,804 --> 01:14:03,123
Shadow Of The Colossus was a really
fascinating game in a lot of ways.

1393
01:14:03,124 --> 01:14:05,283
It was a really meditative game.

1394
01:14:05,284 --> 01:14:09,284
You played a character who lived
in a fantasy world, whose mission was

1395
01:14:09,684 --> 01:14:13,363
to rescue a princess which is
a very basic video game set-up.

1396
01:14:13,364 --> 01:14:16,803
Your job in the game is to bring
down these huge creatures.

1397
01:14:16,804 --> 01:14:19,363
It's like seven huge boss battles

1398
01:14:19,364 --> 01:14:21,603
where the bosses
are not only monsters

1399
01:14:21,604 --> 01:14:24,963
but so big that they are
almost a landscape in themselves

1400
01:14:24,964 --> 01:14:27,123
and gradually as the game goes on,

1401
01:14:27,124 --> 01:14:29,923
your feelings as you bring down
these monsters

1402
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:32,043
become more and more complicated.

1403
01:14:32,044 --> 01:14:35,803
Because every time you killed one
of these creatures, you realise you

1404
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:39,363
just killed something magnificent,
something larger-than-life.

1405
01:14:39,364 --> 01:14:41,923
This beautiful majestic animal

1406
01:14:41,924 --> 01:14:44,763
and you just slaughtered it
for some unknown reason.

1407
01:14:44,764 --> 01:14:48,764
And every time you did one of those
things your character design

1408
01:14:48,964 --> 01:14:51,283
slowly morphed
and became darker and darker

1409
01:14:51,284 --> 01:14:55,284
and you realise
you are the villain of this world.

1410
01:14:58,084 --> 01:14:59,883
Shadow Of The Colossus
was significant

1411
01:14:59,884 --> 01:15:02,243
because it helped forge
a new way of looking at games,

1412
01:15:02,244 --> 01:15:06,243
one in which the player could no
longer be certain they were the hero.

1413
01:15:06,244 --> 01:15:09,563
It also influenced recent indie
titles like Papers, Please

1414
01:15:09,564 --> 01:15:11,243
which, despite its basic appearance,

1415
01:15:11,244 --> 01:15:15,163
is a complex game that causes
the player increasing discomfort.

1416
01:15:15,164 --> 01:15:17,923
Papers, Please is a game
where you are a customs officer

1417
01:15:17,924 --> 01:15:20,803
working on a fictional border
of a made-up country

1418
01:15:20,804 --> 01:15:22,883
and you have to check
everyone's paperwork

1419
01:15:22,884 --> 01:15:25,203
to see whether or not
they can come into the country.

1420
01:15:25,204 --> 01:15:28,283
The mechanics is, like, someone
approaches kind of the checkpoint

1421
01:15:28,284 --> 01:15:31,283
and hands you their papers and they
might ask you to let them in,

1422
01:15:31,284 --> 01:15:34,803
they have family starving inside or
they're trying to bring something to them

1423
01:15:34,804 --> 01:15:37,403
but your job is just to check
whether their paper is forged,

1424
01:15:37,404 --> 01:15:38,723
do they have all their papers

1425
01:15:38,724 --> 01:15:42,243
and whether to allow them
to get in or reject them.

1426
01:15:42,244 --> 01:15:45,123
You quickly realise
you've got to be a bit evil.

1427
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:48,523
If you do not make the quota every day
for stamping enough people through,

1428
01:15:48,524 --> 01:15:51,043
you don't get enough money
to feed your wife and kids.

1429
01:15:51,044 --> 01:15:52,763
And it's the sort of game
where you play it

1430
01:15:52,764 --> 01:15:55,563
and you realise why people
do bad things.

1431
01:15:55,564 --> 01:15:58,923
It puts you into a position where you
slide and you go, "All right, well,

1432
01:15:58,924 --> 01:16:01,923
"just one person," and before you
know it, you are completely corrupt.

1433
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:03,963
And yet you never really
noticed it happening.

1434
01:16:03,964 --> 01:16:07,964
Through those mechanics you feel a
feeling that is so unique to gaming.

1435
01:16:08,644 --> 01:16:10,163
You feel guilt.

1436
01:16:10,164 --> 01:16:11,843
And a movie
can't make you feel guilty,

1437
01:16:11,844 --> 01:16:13,843
a book can't make you feel guilty
but here's, like,

1438
01:16:13,844 --> 01:16:16,403
I'm making an action
and somebody can curse me

1439
01:16:16,404 --> 01:16:20,404
because of it and I feel guilty and
it's kind of brilliant in that way.

1440
01:16:20,684 --> 01:16:23,443
Games excel at making you
stand in other people's shoes.

1441
01:16:23,444 --> 01:16:26,523
Not just the shoes of corrupt
Eastern European officials

1442
01:16:26,524 --> 01:16:28,763
but creatures so phantasmagorical,

1443
01:16:28,764 --> 01:16:32,243
so beyond our imaginations
they don't even need shoes.

1444
01:16:32,244 --> 01:16:36,244
Imagine that. You can't!

1445
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:42,603
Something happened in the mid-2000s
with the rise of what's called

1446
01:16:42,604 --> 01:16:44,443
the massively multiplayer game

1447
01:16:44,444 --> 01:16:45,603
and this was the point

1448
01:16:45,604 --> 01:16:49,523
in which the line between games and
reality started to get quite blurred.

1449
01:16:49,524 --> 01:16:50,603
My wife got super into it

1450
01:16:50,604 --> 01:16:52,803
and so did my son and what was nice
in actual fact

1451
01:16:52,804 --> 01:16:55,683
was it became quite a nice mother
and son thing to do together.

1452
01:16:55,684 --> 01:16:58,443
It was very interesting, you know,
they would go on raids together.

1453
01:16:58,444 --> 01:17:00,323
You know, where else can a woman,

1454
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:03,043
a grown woman who's mothered
several children

1455
01:17:03,044 --> 01:17:06,243
and written several hit movies,
go out with her son,

1456
01:17:06,244 --> 01:17:10,163
skin some animals, kill a troll, OK,
win some gold

1457
01:17:10,164 --> 01:17:13,963
and still see a lovely bit of scenery in
a lovely new mythical city? Nowhere.

1458
01:17:13,964 --> 01:17:17,443
The problem with a game this
seductive is it can also be quite addictive.

1459
01:17:17,444 --> 01:17:21,403
Regularly,
I would play for 14 hours straight.

1460
01:17:21,404 --> 01:17:22,843
When I would be raiding.

1461
01:17:22,844 --> 01:17:25,683
I would do a couple of raids a day
and then I'd have to do upkeep

1462
01:17:25,684 --> 01:17:26,963
in between the raids.

1463
01:17:26,964 --> 01:17:30,043
You hear of people who would
sit there, especially men,

1464
01:17:30,044 --> 01:17:34,044
I have to say, who will sit
there with buckets or bottles

1465
01:17:35,284 --> 01:17:37,963
attached to their nether regions
so they don't have to move.

1466
01:17:37,964 --> 01:17:40,043
They can play constantly
and just pee in a bottle.

1467
01:17:40,044 --> 01:17:43,323
The cliched image of World
Of Warcraft players as addicted

1468
01:17:43,324 --> 01:17:46,203
shut-in husks neglecting
their own lives was memorably

1469
01:17:46,204 --> 01:17:49,643
satirised in
this South Park episode.

1470
01:17:49,644 --> 01:17:53,644
Mum, bathroom! What, hon? Bathroom!

1471
01:17:57,084 --> 01:17:59,203
Oh, that's a big boy, isn't he?

1472
01:17:59,204 --> 01:18:01,243
Yeah, never mind
World Of Warcraft,

1473
01:18:01,244 --> 01:18:03,643
that is the tragedy of all games,
isn't it?

1474
01:18:03,644 --> 01:18:06,083
The way they steal you away
from the real world where all

1475
01:18:06,084 --> 01:18:09,163
the normal people live
and encourage you to stay indoors.

1476
01:18:09,164 --> 01:18:12,003
Gaming is just such a sad,
sedentary pursuit, isn't it?

1477
01:18:12,004 --> 01:18:14,283
It's totally unlike, say,
the way you're sitting there

1478
01:18:14,284 --> 01:18:16,923
in a darkened room
passively watching me say this.

1479
01:18:16,924 --> 01:18:19,243
Box sets are the silver
bullet in this.

1480
01:18:19,244 --> 01:18:22,803
Everyone who complains to you about
playing Far Cry 3 for 30 hours

1481
01:18:22,804 --> 01:18:24,443
has sat through far more

1482
01:18:24,444 --> 01:18:27,283
of that in terms of Game Of Thrones

1483
01:18:27,284 --> 01:18:30,843
and Breaking Bad, all of which is
a pretty sedentary activity.

1484
01:18:30,844 --> 01:18:32,523
And no-one is down on box sets.

1485
01:18:32,524 --> 01:18:34,483
No-one is going,
"These are appalling.

1486
01:18:34,484 --> 01:18:36,363
"Box sets are making
our children fat."

1487
01:18:36,364 --> 01:18:38,083
So that's always been the one
I've gone,

1488
01:18:38,084 --> 01:18:41,083
"Slam! Have you watched a box set
recently?" "Well, of course I have

1489
01:18:41,084 --> 01:18:45,084
"because I have watched Dir Klurgen Furgen,
the new Scandinavian murderer thing."

1490
01:18:45,684 --> 01:18:49,523
How is that different to
playing Grand Theft Auto V?

1491
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:52,403
Yes, you may learn a word or
two of Danish as it goes along

1492
01:18:52,404 --> 01:18:54,763
but it is exactly
the same experience.

1493
01:18:54,764 --> 01:18:58,483
In fact, it's more passive. At least
my thumbs are getting a work-out.

1494
01:18:58,484 --> 01:19:01,523
Never mind a work-out for
your thumbs, what about your other fingers?

1495
01:19:01,524 --> 01:19:05,524
Early video games were simple
and so therefore

1496
01:19:05,884 --> 01:19:09,843
anybody can sort of pick them up
and figure out what to do.

1497
01:19:09,844 --> 01:19:13,403
Then there were overlays
upon overlays upon overlays

1498
01:19:13,404 --> 01:19:17,243
of complexity to where,
if you picked up a PS3 controller,

1499
01:19:17,244 --> 01:19:21,244
it looked a little bit
like the cockpit of a 747.

1500
01:19:21,724 --> 01:19:25,724
The minute you went to
a one-button gesture thing,

1501
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:28,483
it empowered a hole
bunch of new gamers.

1502
01:19:28,484 --> 01:19:32,484
That was really the power of it.

1503
01:19:37,764 --> 01:19:39,803
It sounds too good to be true.

1504
01:19:39,804 --> 01:19:42,163
Being able to play
a game of tennis on your lunch hour

1505
01:19:42,164 --> 01:19:44,243
and you don't even have
to take your suit off.

1506
01:19:44,244 --> 01:19:46,683
It was the first time you could
actually play games

1507
01:19:46,684 --> 01:19:49,443
with your family
and have a level playing field.

1508
01:19:49,444 --> 01:19:52,163
You know, you could hand the
controller to your grandma, your mum,

1509
01:19:52,164 --> 01:19:54,803
and say, "Let's play tennis,"
and they might well beat you at it.

1510
01:19:54,804 --> 01:19:57,563
And for a long-time gamer
that was a great experience.

1511
01:19:57,564 --> 01:20:00,923
Wii Sports is on our list, not because it's
one of the bestselling games of all time,

1512
01:20:00,924 --> 01:20:02,603
shifting over 80 million copies,

1513
01:20:02,604 --> 01:20:04,803
but because it's one
of the most accessible,

1514
01:20:04,804 --> 01:20:07,523
turning gaming into
an even more mainstream pursuit

1515
01:20:07,524 --> 01:20:11,524
that could be easily marketed
at anyone who can do this or...

1516
01:20:11,924 --> 01:20:14,963
this or... this.

1517
01:20:14,964 --> 01:20:16,803
Right, this one is my favourite.
Chop chop.

1518
01:20:16,804 --> 01:20:20,804
I'll cook for you, Marv,
if you want.

1519
01:20:26,164 --> 01:20:29,763
After the spectacular coming of the
Wii was the Microsoft Xbox Kinect

1520
01:20:29,764 --> 01:20:31,603
which did away with the controller

1521
01:20:31,604 --> 01:20:34,363
and instead watched you
with its beady camera eye

1522
01:20:34,364 --> 01:20:37,323
and judged your every action
like Orwell's Big Brother but fun.

1523
01:20:37,324 --> 01:20:40,363
The new incarnation of the Xbox
comes bundled with this more

1524
01:20:40,364 --> 01:20:44,123
advanced, bulkier version
of the Kinect which can now

1525
01:20:44,124 --> 01:20:47,243
analyse your heartbeat
and facial expression.

1526
01:20:47,244 --> 01:20:49,683
Gesture technology has now
dribbled out of gaming

1527
01:20:49,684 --> 01:20:53,643
and into other everyday gizmos like
smartphones and even televisions

1528
01:20:53,644 --> 01:20:57,644
which now routinely require you
to wave at them like some kind of peasant,

1529
01:20:57,804 --> 01:20:59,963
as we can see
from this unsettling advert.

1530
01:20:59,964 --> 01:21:02,883
And the gaming world hasn't finished
invading your life just because

1531
01:21:02,884 --> 01:21:06,683
it's taught you to perform a few
gestures like some kind of gibbon.

1532
01:21:06,684 --> 01:21:11,402
No, as we'll see, it's after
nothing less than your soul.

1533
01:21:18,484 --> 01:21:20,283
2007 was grim.

1534
01:21:20,284 --> 01:21:23,443
Even the launch of the spangly new
iPhone couldn't distract anyone

1535
01:21:23,444 --> 01:21:26,843
from the unrelenting misery
of the global economic crisis.

1536
01:21:26,844 --> 01:21:28,603
What could you do for
cheap escapism?

1537
01:21:28,604 --> 01:21:31,083
The cinema was full of
crappy threequels

1538
01:21:31,084 --> 01:21:33,323
and a new Transformers movie,
so that was out.

1539
01:21:33,324 --> 01:21:37,324
And thanks to the smoking ban, pubs
now stank of sweat and arse gas.

1540
01:21:38,004 --> 01:21:41,283
Fortunately, there was one form of
entertainment that still delivered,

1541
01:21:41,284 --> 01:21:45,284
and it chiefly delivered by letting
you shoot people in the face.

1542
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:51,363
This action-packed epic is very much

1543
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:53,923
the Citizen Kane of
remorseless gunfire.

1544
01:21:53,924 --> 01:21:57,763
Modern Warfare's about putting
you into the shoes of a soldier,

1545
01:21:57,764 --> 01:22:00,003
putting you in the middle
of a battle.

1546
01:22:00,004 --> 01:22:04,004
And not just as the lone superhero,
but as part of this giant machine.

1547
01:22:04,164 --> 01:22:06,563
It's a world going on around you.

1548
01:22:06,564 --> 01:22:08,003
The Call Of Duty franchise

1549
01:22:08,004 --> 01:22:10,323
is impeccably produced
and fun to play,

1550
01:22:10,324 --> 01:22:13,403
but also, so brutal, many find it
hard to stomach.

1551
01:22:13,404 --> 01:22:15,963
For my money, the most disturbing
mission in Modern Warfare

1552
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:17,323
is Death From Above.

1553
01:22:17,324 --> 01:22:19,603
A mission that puts
you in an AC130 gunship

1554
01:22:19,604 --> 01:22:22,123
and puts a kind of grainy film
over the camera,

1555
01:22:22,124 --> 01:22:26,083
as you're looking down, shooting
at targets you can't even recognise.

1556
01:22:26,084 --> 01:22:28,283
It's the only mission
in Modern Warfare

1557
01:22:28,284 --> 01:22:31,723
that could be photorealistic
because the real-life footage

1558
01:22:31,724 --> 01:22:35,203
we see on the news from AC130s is
grainy, and it's tremendously

1559
01:22:35,204 --> 01:22:38,683
disturbing, because you can't make
out what these figures are.

1560
01:22:38,684 --> 01:22:41,083
It could be, it could almost
be a statement,

1561
01:22:41,084 --> 01:22:45,003
but it's not, it's just there so you
can have fun, and that's very dark.

1562
01:22:45,004 --> 01:22:48,083
Every Call Of Duty game seems to
have its banner moment, which is

1563
01:22:48,084 --> 01:22:49,643
almost deliberately conceived.

1564
01:22:49,644 --> 01:22:52,203
Oh, this is the level that will get
us all in the headlines

1565
01:22:52,204 --> 01:22:53,923
in the Daily Mail and the Sun,

1566
01:22:53,924 --> 01:22:56,723
and these are the things people
will complain about.

1567
01:22:56,724 --> 01:22:58,323
I think that's a little bit cynical.

1568
01:22:58,324 --> 01:23:02,123
The game's success also lends the debate
about violence an interesting new kink.

1569
01:23:02,124 --> 01:23:05,403
Many of the guns it features
are real-world weapons,

1570
01:23:05,404 --> 01:23:08,243
licensed with the manufacturer's
full consent.

1571
01:23:08,244 --> 01:23:11,483
It's a kind of grim product
placement which means the game

1572
01:23:11,484 --> 01:23:15,484
doubles as a shop window for future
gun owners, albeit inadvertently.

1573
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:17,803
The trouble is, some of its more
fanatical fans

1574
01:23:17,804 --> 01:23:20,083
are the very last people you'd want
owning guns.

1575
01:23:20,084 --> 01:23:22,563
Or even rocks, to be honest.

1576
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:25,123
Fucking come out of there, bitch!
Go on! Get out!

1577
01:23:25,124 --> 01:23:27,483
Fucking lightweight and marathon,

1578
01:23:27,484 --> 01:23:29,524
you think you're fucking good,
get the fuck!

1579
01:23:31,244 --> 01:23:34,363
Call Of Duty is the prime example
of a game

1580
01:23:34,364 --> 01:23:38,364
with a horrible player base,
in terms of behaviour online.

1581
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:42,764
Oh, my God! Get the fuck
out, you stupid fucking dosshead!

1582
01:23:44,484 --> 01:23:47,443
There's a joke that comedians tell
called The Aristocrats,

1583
01:23:47,444 --> 01:23:51,283
which is just basically just the most
offensive joke you can possibly tell,

1584
01:23:51,284 --> 01:23:54,923
and playing Call Of Duty with
a headset on is like listening

1585
01:23:54,924 --> 01:23:58,924
to a children's choir sing the longest,
most vile Aristocrats joke, in your ear.

1586
01:24:01,164 --> 01:24:02,363
For hours.

1587
01:24:02,364 --> 01:24:03,763
It's intolerable.

1588
01:24:03,764 --> 01:24:06,243
I swear to God, I'm going to come
over there,

1589
01:24:06,244 --> 01:24:09,923
I'm going to fuck your mom like
the pig she is.

1590
01:24:09,924 --> 01:24:11,883
All of that could lead you
to believe

1591
01:24:11,884 --> 01:24:14,083
that present-day gaming is horrible.

1592
01:24:14,084 --> 01:24:15,123
Not necessarily.

1593
01:24:15,124 --> 01:24:17,123
Video games are in an amazing
place right now.

1594
01:24:17,124 --> 01:24:19,363
Because you've got these giant
blockbuster games

1595
01:24:19,364 --> 01:24:22,043
that are like giant Hollywood movies
and then you've also got

1596
01:24:22,044 --> 01:24:24,123
the equivalent of the independent
film scene.

1597
01:24:24,124 --> 01:24:26,563
You've got games that are made by
one person, two people,

1598
01:24:26,564 --> 01:24:29,243
little teams who are saying
something that they want to say.

1599
01:24:29,244 --> 01:24:32,483
Just like indie films came about
when the cost of making films

1600
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:34,163
was drastically reduced, now,

1601
01:24:34,164 --> 01:24:37,723
tools and publishing options
are available for essentially,

1602
01:24:37,724 --> 01:24:40,683
the little guys, who just want
to put their game out there,

1603
01:24:40,684 --> 01:24:43,723
games that don't have so much
appeal, but cost SO much less.

1604
01:24:43,724 --> 01:24:46,803
They can recoup their investment
with just a few thousand sales.

1605
01:24:46,804 --> 01:24:50,443
Suddenly, it seemed the
idiosyncratic bedroom coder of the 1980s

1606
01:24:50,444 --> 01:24:54,204
was back with a vengeance, like
someone had turned back the clock.

1607
01:24:55,364 --> 01:24:59,364
And an unusual time-twisting
indie platform game called Braid

1608
01:24:59,604 --> 01:25:03,604
led the charge.

1609
01:25:09,244 --> 01:25:13,244
Braid is a puzzle platformer,
and it was created by Jonathan Blow.

1610
01:25:14,564 --> 01:25:16,643
On the surface it's all about a guy

1611
01:25:16,644 --> 01:25:19,243
trying to rescue
a princess from a horrible monster.

1612
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:22,203
When you first pick it up,
I'm just playing a platform game.

1613
01:25:22,204 --> 01:25:24,723
But, then, going into kind
of the fourth dimension,

1614
01:25:24,724 --> 01:25:27,763
playing with concepts of time,
and reversing and speeding up

1615
01:25:27,764 --> 01:25:30,643
and manipulating time in
a way that took something

1616
01:25:30,644 --> 01:25:33,723
that looked familiar and completely
reinvented it.

1617
01:25:33,724 --> 01:25:37,724
One aesthetic thing I didn't like
about it was, the main character.

1618
01:25:39,244 --> 01:25:41,923
Just didn't care for the little guy.

1619
01:25:41,924 --> 01:25:44,843
He looked like a sort of
squashed Hugh Grant.

1620
01:25:44,844 --> 01:25:47,603
HE LAUGHS
You know, that's just my taste.

1621
01:25:47,604 --> 01:25:51,604
I'm not a fan of
miniaturised Hugh Grants.

1622
01:25:51,804 --> 01:25:54,443
Braid is almost a game that's
kind of too smart for its own good.

1623
01:25:54,444 --> 01:25:58,323
Almost, I kind of feel that it's
a game you admire.

1624
01:25:58,324 --> 01:26:01,243
But I definitely remember reaching
a point where I was like,

1625
01:26:01,244 --> 01:26:02,923
I'm not really having fun any more.

1626
01:26:02,924 --> 01:26:04,883
And that's fine,
that's absolutely fine,

1627
01:26:04,884 --> 01:26:08,243
because I think, for indie games,
they have to explore what a game is.

1628
01:26:08,244 --> 01:26:11,043
Braid earns a place on our list
for proving indie games could sell,

1629
01:26:11,044 --> 01:26:15,044
paving the way for other individual
and experimental titles.

1630
01:26:15,124 --> 01:26:19,124
Braid was swiftly followed
then by Limbo, which, again,

1631
01:26:19,324 --> 01:26:23,123
was a beautifully stylised,
very emotionally wrenching story

1632
01:26:23,124 --> 01:26:26,763
of a small boy walking through
a kind of ethereal landscape.

1633
01:26:26,764 --> 01:26:29,923
Journey is probably the most
famous example of that.

1634
01:26:29,924 --> 01:26:31,363
Fabulously beautiful.

1635
01:26:31,364 --> 01:26:33,603
Incredibly emotionally involving.

1636
01:26:33,604 --> 01:26:37,203
There's a point where the little
fella just can't quite make it up

1637
01:26:37,204 --> 01:26:39,563
a snowy mountain and Jesus,
it'll get ya!

1638
01:26:39,564 --> 01:26:42,763
Many of the new wave of indie titles
hark back to the retro past,

1639
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:46,764
offering subversive or surprising
reimaginings of gaming's heritage.

1640
01:26:46,964 --> 01:26:49,643
And indie games aren't something
you have to seek out

1641
01:26:49,644 --> 01:26:51,163
in some obscure hobby shop.

1642
01:26:51,164 --> 01:26:52,363
Today, you can buy them

1643
01:26:52,364 --> 01:26:55,283
without leaving
the comfort of your own hand.

1644
01:26:55,284 --> 01:26:58,563
There's this whole line of video game
genealogy that starts off with

1645
01:26:58,564 --> 01:27:00,563
the arcades and moves through
the Game Boy

1646
01:27:00,564 --> 01:27:01,963
and stuff like Tetris and Mario

1647
01:27:01,964 --> 01:27:04,203
and ends up with modern
arcade-like mobile games

1648
01:27:04,204 --> 01:27:06,243
like Candy Crush and Angry Birds.

1649
01:27:06,244 --> 01:27:08,643
Games started off as something
that everybody played.

1650
01:27:08,644 --> 01:27:12,644
And now, again, they're something
that everybody plays.

1651
01:27:16,924 --> 01:27:19,643
Lots of people that didn't really
think of themselves as gamers

1652
01:27:19,644 --> 01:27:22,723
will play something like Angry Birds
because it's like a time killer.

1653
01:27:22,724 --> 01:27:24,603
Wherever you are,
whatever you're doing,

1654
01:27:24,604 --> 01:27:27,683
in a doctor's waiting room, on the
bus, if you're bored on the Tube,

1655
01:27:27,684 --> 01:27:30,323
you can play Angry Birds
and it kills that dead time.

1656
01:27:30,324 --> 01:27:33,763
With its intuitive, visually
appealing gameplay, Angry Birds has

1657
01:27:33,764 --> 01:27:37,283
brought intense hand-held pleasure
to millions, just like your mum has.

1658
01:27:37,284 --> 01:27:39,283
Angry Birds is a nice enough game.

1659
01:27:39,284 --> 01:27:43,083
I don't think it's the best game
in the world, but I mean, certainly,

1660
01:27:43,084 --> 01:27:45,083
it deserves to be a success.

1661
01:27:45,084 --> 01:27:47,963
Whether it deserves to absolutely
rule the entire universe

1662
01:27:47,964 --> 01:27:51,203
to the exception of everything else,
I really don't know.

1663
01:27:51,204 --> 01:27:54,603
Yesterday, when I was buying
my train ticket to come down here,

1664
01:27:54,604 --> 01:27:57,563
I looked over at the ticket clerk's
phone that was lying

1665
01:27:57,564 --> 01:28:00,963
next to the ticket window.
Angry Birds. It's just everywhere.

1666
01:28:00,964 --> 01:28:03,683
Like Pac-Man, way back yonder,
Angry Birds has become

1667
01:28:03,684 --> 01:28:06,563
an unstoppable kiddiewink
merchandising phenomenon,

1668
01:28:06,564 --> 01:28:10,443
with branded goods, cartoon shows,
theme park rides and all.

1669
01:28:10,444 --> 01:28:13,523
But Angry Birds isn't the only
indie game to have built an empire.

1670
01:28:13,524 --> 01:28:17,524
Our next game is, if anything,
an even more impressive achievement.

1671
01:28:22,364 --> 01:28:25,083
Minecraft is just one of those
bits of gaming genius.

1672
01:28:25,084 --> 01:28:28,723
I think you can sum up the appeal
of Minecraft effectively by saying

1673
01:28:28,724 --> 01:28:31,123
that it's Lego of video games.

1674
01:28:31,124 --> 01:28:33,283
Minecraft is an open world game
which lets players

1675
01:28:33,284 --> 01:28:36,483
shape their environment by placing
or destroying blocks.

1676
01:28:36,484 --> 01:28:38,683
It's easy, it's creative
and it's social.

1677
01:28:38,684 --> 01:28:42,283
The beautiful thing with Minecraft
is that you see people playing

1678
01:28:42,284 --> 01:28:46,003
together to create something,
to build some massive project.

1679
01:28:46,004 --> 01:28:50,004
People coming together to build replicas
of the Starship Enterprise, and stuff like that,

1680
01:28:50,924 --> 01:28:53,123
within Minecraft,
and that's a lovely thing,

1681
01:28:53,124 --> 01:28:56,083
because most of the time in games,
people come together

1682
01:28:56,084 --> 01:28:57,883
to destroy stuff, and each other.

1683
01:28:57,884 --> 01:29:01,363
Minecraft became a hit,
selling over 33 million copies.

1684
01:29:01,364 --> 01:29:04,483
And its most enthusiastic
fans are children.

1685
01:29:04,484 --> 01:29:07,763
Children can interact with Minecraft
and it allows them

1686
01:29:07,764 --> 01:29:10,083
to be creative in a way that
nothing else does.

1687
01:29:10,084 --> 01:29:12,523
Like, reading a book is great,
it's wonderful,

1688
01:29:12,524 --> 01:29:15,563
but it doesn't allow them to be
part of that fantasy. Minecraft does.

1689
01:29:15,564 --> 01:29:18,523
And they create these huge
worlds for themselves,

1690
01:29:18,524 --> 01:29:19,923
these huge structures,

1691
01:29:19,924 --> 01:29:23,763
not because someone is telling them
to, but because they want to.

1692
01:29:23,764 --> 01:29:27,764
And they're probably learning so
much about teamwork and design and

1693
01:29:29,404 --> 01:29:33,404
architecture and the environment,
just through playing this game.

1694
01:29:33,644 --> 01:29:35,363
You get lots of teachers now,

1695
01:29:35,364 --> 01:29:39,364
geography teachers use Minecraft to
get children to design villages.

1696
01:29:39,564 --> 01:29:42,803
You get physics teachers now using
Minecraft to teach kids

1697
01:29:42,804 --> 01:29:44,523
about simple mechanisms.

1698
01:29:44,524 --> 01:29:48,524
And finally, I made it work.
The Minecraft escalator.

1699
01:29:48,564 --> 01:29:50,203
It really communicates to kids.

1700
01:29:50,204 --> 01:29:52,483
My children,
my sons play Minecraft a lot.

1701
01:29:52,484 --> 01:29:56,484
My older son is on
the autism spectrum.

1702
01:29:57,004 --> 01:30:00,203
To him, Minecraft is so valuable,
because it's a world of logic

1703
01:30:00,204 --> 01:30:03,003
and creativity, which he
immediately understands.

1704
01:30:03,004 --> 01:30:04,963
This is the same for all children.

1705
01:30:04,964 --> 01:30:07,203
Like, it's really helped my son,
in a lot of ways,

1706
01:30:07,204 --> 01:30:10,323
to kind of express himself, which is
really profoundly important.

1707
01:30:10,324 --> 01:30:13,363
I'd love to shake the maker of
that game by the hand,

1708
01:30:13,364 --> 01:30:17,243
because I think he's
kind of changed my son's life.

1709
01:30:17,244 --> 01:30:20,083
So, the world of games has
become like the world of cinema,

1710
01:30:20,084 --> 01:30:22,923
with multimillion dollar
blockbusters to one side

1711
01:30:22,924 --> 01:30:25,843
and low-budget,
cerebral indie titles on the other.

1712
01:30:25,844 --> 01:30:28,523
But now, there are signs
of a third way emerging.

1713
01:30:28,524 --> 01:30:31,563
We're seeing the beginnings of
the gaming equivalent

1714
01:30:31,564 --> 01:30:33,923
of the critically acclaimed
HBO box set.

1715
01:30:33,924 --> 01:30:36,283
Where did you get the money for this?

1716
01:30:36,284 --> 01:30:38,403
Drugs. I sell hardcore drugs.

1717
01:30:38,404 --> 01:30:41,403
Oh, good. Well, start helping out
with the mortgage, then.

1718
01:30:41,404 --> 01:30:42,523
Tsk! Yeah, you wish!

1719
01:30:42,524 --> 01:30:45,483
Jimmy? Dad? I'm coming. Come here.

1720
01:30:45,484 --> 01:30:48,003
Jimmy?

1721
01:30:48,004 --> 01:30:50,043
Jimmy, stay back!

1722
01:30:50,044 --> 01:30:53,763
Jimmy, I am warning you. Stop!

1723
01:30:53,764 --> 01:30:56,763
The Last Of Us is the story of these
two survivors

1724
01:30:56,764 --> 01:30:59,883
in a world that has been ravaged by
this pandemic.

1725
01:30:59,884 --> 01:31:03,883
And we follow Joel, this
middle-aged survivor,

1726
01:31:03,884 --> 01:31:06,483
who's going to do anything
it takes to survive,

1727
01:31:06,484 --> 01:31:08,163
cross kind of any moral line

1728
01:31:08,164 --> 01:31:11,283
and, through circumstances, he ends
up teaming up

1729
01:31:11,284 --> 01:31:14,603
with this 14-year-old teenager,
girl, Ellie.

1730
01:31:14,604 --> 01:31:17,163
I need a gun. No, you don't.

1731
01:31:17,164 --> 01:31:18,563
Joel?

1732
01:31:18,564 --> 01:31:21,443
I can handle myself. No!

1733
01:31:21,444 --> 01:31:25,444
I think Ellie in The Last Of Us
was a great female character.

1734
01:31:25,924 --> 01:31:29,523
She's young, but she's very capable,
but she's also got

1735
01:31:29,524 --> 01:31:33,443
this interesting vulnerability
and she's not grown up in our world.

1736
01:31:33,444 --> 01:31:36,723
I've never been in a plane.

1737
01:31:36,724 --> 01:31:37,963
Isn't that weird?

1738
01:31:37,964 --> 01:31:40,323
And she can't really
kind of understand it

1739
01:31:40,324 --> 01:31:43,323
and she sort of brings a unique
perspective because of that.

1740
01:31:43,324 --> 01:31:47,324
She can't envisage a time
when young teenage girls were just

1741
01:31:47,524 --> 01:31:50,203
sort of obsessed with boys,
and looking good.

1742
01:31:50,204 --> 01:31:52,203
That's completely alien to her.

1743
01:31:52,204 --> 01:31:55,723
Is this really all
they had to worry about?

1744
01:31:55,724 --> 01:31:59,123
Boys? Movies?

1745
01:31:59,124 --> 01:32:01,683
Deciding which shirt goes
with which skirt?

1746
01:32:01,684 --> 01:32:04,283
It's bizarre.

1747
01:32:04,284 --> 01:32:06,763
Like any self-respecting
box set drama,

1748
01:32:06,764 --> 01:32:09,483
the game gradually
and inexorably moves towards

1749
01:32:09,484 --> 01:32:12,043
a fulfilling,
some might say devastating climax.

1750
01:32:12,044 --> 01:32:16,044
For the first time in my life,
I was crying, as I held a controller

1751
01:32:17,004 --> 01:32:18,843
and moved a character around.

1752
01:32:18,844 --> 01:32:22,523
I'm really glad my wife didn't come
in, but I was just kind of going...

1753
01:32:22,524 --> 01:32:24,123
Oh, my God.

1754
01:32:24,124 --> 01:32:26,483
Game designers are getting older.

1755
01:32:26,484 --> 01:32:28,923
Lots of the big game
designers are in their 30s and 40s

1756
01:32:28,924 --> 01:32:30,683
and they have children,

1757
01:32:30,684 --> 01:32:33,803
and they suddenly are thinking
about games in a different way.

1758
01:32:33,804 --> 01:32:36,763
Not as systems,
not as scoring mechanics,

1759
01:32:36,764 --> 01:32:39,883
but as an emotional experience.

1760
01:32:39,884 --> 01:32:41,483
Oh, baby girl.

1761
01:32:41,484 --> 01:32:43,324
It's OK, it's OK.

1762
01:32:45,244 --> 01:32:46,683
In the next five to ten years,

1763
01:32:46,684 --> 01:32:48,923
we're going to see
more games about emotions

1764
01:32:48,924 --> 01:32:51,803
and about social situations,

1765
01:32:51,804 --> 01:32:55,203
about politics and about society,

1766
01:32:55,204 --> 01:32:59,083
because we are now living
in an age where we understand

1767
01:32:59,084 --> 01:33:03,084
what happens around us in a very
interactive and very digital way.

1768
01:33:03,164 --> 01:33:06,643
So here we are now in 2013 with
games at a bit of a crossroads.

1769
01:33:06,644 --> 01:33:09,803
From the monochrome simplicity
of Pong, they've transformed

1770
01:33:09,804 --> 01:33:12,763
via this series of technological
and conceptual shockwaves

1771
01:33:12,764 --> 01:33:15,443
to become the most varied form
of entertainment

1772
01:33:15,444 --> 01:33:16,843
since the written word.

1773
01:33:16,844 --> 01:33:18,923
But one thing we've seen
throughout this show

1774
01:33:18,924 --> 01:33:20,523
is that gaming never stands still.

1775
01:33:20,524 --> 01:33:23,843
And, sure enough, a new generation
of hardware has just arrived,

1776
01:33:23,844 --> 01:33:27,003
bringing with it a fresh set
of capabilities which is going to

1777
01:33:27,004 --> 01:33:29,283
overturn everything
that went before.

1778
01:33:29,284 --> 01:33:31,363
As their slick promo
material makes clear,

1779
01:33:31,364 --> 01:33:32,603
the new PlayStation 4

1780
01:33:32,604 --> 01:33:35,563
and Xbox One are both more powerful
than their predecessors,

1781
01:33:35,564 --> 01:33:37,803
but perhaps the biggest clue
to gaming's future

1782
01:33:37,804 --> 01:33:39,243
is their marked new emphasis

1783
01:33:39,244 --> 01:33:42,843
on integrated social networking
features.

1784
01:33:42,844 --> 01:33:46,763
Now, why would games systems want
to include social networking?

1785
01:33:46,764 --> 01:33:50,764
Unless maybe social networking
already functions like a game.

1786
01:33:55,844 --> 01:33:58,283
Twitter is a massively multiplayer
online game

1787
01:33:58,284 --> 01:34:01,283
in which you
choose an interesting avatar

1788
01:34:01,284 --> 01:34:03,803
and then role-play a persona
loosely based on your own,

1789
01:34:03,804 --> 01:34:06,563
attempting to recruit followers
by repeatedly pressing

1790
01:34:06,564 --> 01:34:09,043
lettered buttons to form
interesting sentences.

1791
01:34:09,044 --> 01:34:12,603
The biggest way in which video games
have affected our world,

1792
01:34:12,604 --> 01:34:15,763
for me, is the increasing
gameification of real life.

1793
01:34:15,764 --> 01:34:17,443
Stuff like Twitter is a game.

1794
01:34:17,444 --> 01:34:20,563
It's about small achievements
adding up to bigger ones.

1795
01:34:20,564 --> 01:34:24,564
And it's about playing
the rules of whatever you're in.

1796
01:34:24,644 --> 01:34:28,283
Gameification means applying
the mechanics of video games to real-life.

1797
01:34:28,284 --> 01:34:31,523
Now, often, this boils down
to incentivising people

1798
01:34:31,524 --> 01:34:34,283
to perform the same
action over and over.

1799
01:34:34,284 --> 01:34:36,923
Each time Mario headbutts a block,
he gets a coin.

1800
01:34:36,924 --> 01:34:39,523
When he gets 100 coins,
he gets an extra life,

1801
01:34:39,524 --> 01:34:42,003
and these perpetual little
pats on the head

1802
01:34:42,004 --> 01:34:44,003
compel you to bash
those blocks for hours.

1803
01:34:44,004 --> 01:34:46,803
By supplying a constant stream
of fun-size rewards,

1804
01:34:46,804 --> 01:34:49,563
social networking has, by accident,

1805
01:34:49,564 --> 01:34:52,003
gameified whole aspects
of our lives.

1806
01:34:52,004 --> 01:34:55,923
Every second, another little
gold coin for you to collect.

1807
01:34:55,924 --> 01:34:57,883
More followers, more retweets,

1808
01:34:57,884 --> 01:35:00,723
compelling you to
interact over and over again.

1809
01:35:00,724 --> 01:35:04,043
These are games we don't even
realise we're playing.

1810
01:35:04,044 --> 01:35:08,044
Every day, you have a drama and you
have everyone sort of piling in

1811
01:35:08,924 --> 01:35:12,763
to be the one to talk about,
to be the one who gets retweeted.

1812
01:35:12,764 --> 01:35:16,764
It has become kind of a game
that I find myself gauging,

1813
01:35:17,284 --> 01:35:19,803
when I do a tweet,
how popular it's going to be

1814
01:35:19,804 --> 01:35:22,963
and I try to guess ahead of time,
like, how many retweets

1815
01:35:22,964 --> 01:35:25,923
is that going to get, and how many
favourites is that going to get.

1816
01:35:25,924 --> 01:35:29,924
In terms of the competition,
especially between, like,

1817
01:35:30,164 --> 01:35:34,003
celebrities or people with
the verification tick,

1818
01:35:34,004 --> 01:35:35,163
every time I see someone,

1819
01:35:35,164 --> 01:35:37,363
or every time someone's talking
about someone,

1820
01:35:37,364 --> 01:35:40,523
they're talking about,
oh, I've got 50,000,

1821
01:35:40,524 --> 01:35:43,883
I've got a million
followers, I've got this.

1822
01:35:43,884 --> 01:35:46,643
And it very much reminded me
of a lot of games like that.

1823
01:35:46,644 --> 01:35:49,603
It was always about how many points
you got. It ups your profile

1824
01:35:49,604 --> 01:35:52,483
and makes you feel like you're doing
something in your life.

1825
01:35:52,484 --> 01:35:56,243
What I do on Twitter a lot is just
project a false persona.

1826
01:35:56,244 --> 01:35:57,843
And it is like that avatar thing.

1827
01:35:57,844 --> 01:36:00,363
It's like World of Warcraft
or anything like that.

1828
01:36:00,364 --> 01:36:03,563
The way I am on Twitter is nothing
like the way I am in real life.

1829
01:36:03,564 --> 01:36:05,923
That feels like a game, sometimes,
you know what I mean?

1830
01:36:05,924 --> 01:36:09,483
If you're a sociopath,
feels like a game.

1831
01:36:09,484 --> 01:36:12,243
So, how have video games
changed the world?

1832
01:36:12,244 --> 01:36:14,683
Well, they've entertained us,
they've put us in the shoes

1833
01:36:14,684 --> 01:36:16,643
of cartoon characters
in fantastic settings,

1834
01:36:16,644 --> 01:36:18,323
they've made spatial reasoning fun,

1835
01:36:18,324 --> 01:36:21,443
they've allowed people to connect
and explore nonexistent worlds,

1836
01:36:21,444 --> 01:36:24,363
they've helped bridge the gap
between Eastern and Western culture,

1837
01:36:24,364 --> 01:36:26,603
they've provided a safe space
to run riot,

1838
01:36:26,604 --> 01:36:29,643
to fantasise out loud without anyone
actually getting killed,

1839
01:36:29,644 --> 01:36:31,883
they've handed a generation
of creative thinkers

1840
01:36:31,884 --> 01:36:34,123
a whole new set of tools
to express themselves with,

1841
01:36:34,124 --> 01:36:36,763
and they've inspired
and instructed millions of children.

1842
01:36:36,764 --> 01:36:38,243
Not that anyone cares about them!

1843
01:36:38,244 --> 01:36:40,963
But, perhaps most significantly,
possibly sinisterly,

1844
01:36:40,964 --> 01:36:43,443
games have now burrowed, by stealth,

1845
01:36:43,444 --> 01:36:45,323
into aspects of our social lives
online

1846
01:36:45,324 --> 01:36:47,923
and we, in response,
have cheerfully invited them in,

1847
01:36:47,924 --> 01:36:49,803
and that trend's just going
to continue

1848
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:52,443
until whole areas of our existence
have become games.

1849
01:36:52,444 --> 01:36:54,803
In fact, you'll scarcely
be known as you any more.

1850
01:36:54,804 --> 01:36:56,523
You'll just be known as Player One.

1851
01:36:56,524 --> 01:37:00,363
You might as well change your name
by deed poll now and have done with it.

1852
01:37:00,364 --> 01:37:02,443
That's the end of the programme now.

1853
01:37:02,444 --> 01:37:04,923
I'd say game over,
but only a prick would say that.

1854
01:37:04,924 --> 01:37:06,427
Get out of my show.

1855
01:37:06,452 --> 01:37:35,060
