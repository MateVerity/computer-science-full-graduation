Hi,

I created the song "Find the Longest Path" that you have posted at
[snip].  I wrote it while a grad student at Johns Hopkins University
on May 1, 1988, during a difficult "Algorithms II" final exam.  I also
recorded the song and it's been played at several mathematics
conferences.  If you wouldn't mind, please credit me as author on your
site. Thanks!

--------------------------

Woh, oh-oh-oh
Find the Longest Path
Woh oh-oh
Find the Longest Path
If you said P is NP tonight
There would still be papers left to write
I have a weakness
I'm addicted to completeness
And I keep searching for the longest Path

The algorithm I would like to see
Is of Polynomial Degree
Buts its elusive,
Nobody has found conclusive
Evidence that we can find the Longest Path

I have been hard
Working for so long
I swear its right,
And he marks it wrong
Somehow I'll feel sorry when its done
GPA 2.1,
Is more than I hoped for

Garey, Johnson, Karp and other Men (and Women)
Try to make it Order n log n.
Am I a math fool
If I spend my life in Grad School
Forever following the Longest Path.

Woh oh-oh-oh
Find the longest path
Woh oh-oh-oh
Find the longest path
