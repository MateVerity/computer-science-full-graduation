espresso - Boolean Minimization  
<H2><A NAME="sect1" HREF="#toc1">Synopsis </A></H2>

</I>] [<I>file </I>]  
<H2><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#toc2">Description </A></H2>
<P>
<I>Espresso</I> takes as input a two-level representation 
of a two-valued (or multiple-valued) Boolean function, and produces a minimal 
equivalent representation.  The algorithms used are new and represent an 
advance in both speed and optimality of solution in heuristic Boolean 
minimization. <P>
<I>Espresso</I> reads the <I>file </I> provided (or standard input if no 
files are specified), performs the minimization, and writes the minimized 
result to standard output. <I>Espresso</I> automatically verifies that the minimized 
function is equivalent to the original function. Options allow for using 
an exact minimization algorithm, for choosing an optimal phase assignment 
for the output functions, and for choosing an optimal assignment of the 
inputs to input decoders. <P>
The default input and output file formats are 
compatible with the Berkeley standard format for the physical description 
of a <FONT SIZE=-1>PLA</FONT>
.  The input format is described in detail in <A HREF="man_octtools_espresso_inputs.html">espresso(5)</A>
.  Note 
that the input file is a <I>logical </I> representation of a set of Boolean equations, 
and hence the input format differs slightly from that described in <A HREF="man_octtools_pla.html">pla(5)</A>
 
(which provides for the <I>physical </I> representation of a <FONT SIZE=-1>PLA</FONT>
). The input and 
output formats have been expanded to allow for multiple-valued logic functions, 
and to allow for the specification of the don't-care set which will be used 
in the minimization. <P>
A complete list of the command line options is given 
below. Be warned that many of the command line options are not intended 
for general use. 
<DL>

<DT><B>-d</B>  </DT>
<DD>Enables debugging. Useful only for those familiar with 
the algorithms used. </DD>

<DT><B>-Dcheck</B>  </DT>
<DD>Checks that the function is a partition of 
the entire space (i.e., that the <FONT SIZE=-1>ON</FONT>
-set, <FONT SIZE=-1>OFF</FONT>
-set and <FONT SIZE=-1>DC</FONT>
-set are pairwise disjoint, 
and that their union is the Universe).  </DD>

<DT><B>-Dd1merge</B>  </DT>
<DD>Performs a quick distance-1 
merge on the input file.  This is useful when the input file is very large 
(e.g., a truth table with more than 1000 terms) because distance-1 merge 
is O(n log n) rather than the <FONT SIZE=-1>EXPAND</FONT>
 step of Espresso which is O(n * n). 
 The output should then be run through Espresso to complete the minimization. 
 A range of variables to be merged can also be specified using <B>-rn-m</B> (the 
default is to merge over all variables).  </DD>

<DT><B>-Decho</B>  </DT>
<DD>Echoes the function to 
standard output. This can be used to get the complement of a function when 
combined with <B>-o </B>.  </DD>

<DT><B>-Dequiv</B>  </DT>
<DD>Identify output variables which are equivalent. 
 Takes into account the don't-care set and checks for equivalence of both 
the <FONT SIZE=-1>ON</FONT>
-set and <FONT SIZE=-1>OFF</FONT>
-set. </DD>

<DT><B>-Dexact</B>  </DT>
<DD>Exact minimization algorithm (guarantees 
minimum number of product terms, and heuristically minimizes number of 
literals). Potentially expensive.  </DD>

<DT><B>-Dmany</B>  </DT>
<DD>Reads and minimizes PLA's until 
end-of-file is detected.  PLA's in the same file are separated by <I>.e </I>.  </DD>

<DT><B>-Dmap</B> 
 </DT>
<DD>Draw the Karnaugh maps for a binary-valued function.  </DD>

<DT><B>-Dmapdc</B>  </DT>
<DD>Derive from 
the binary-valued variable <I>DONT_CARE </I> a don't-care set, and then delete this 
variable. All input conditions for which an output changes when <I>DONT_CARE 
</I> changes define the don't-care conditions for that output. This is a hack 
to support don't-cares from high-level languages without a notion of don't-cares. 
 </DD>

<DT><B>-Dopo</B>  </DT>
<DD>Perform output phase optimization (i.e., determine which functions 
to complement to reduce the number of terms needed to implement the function). 
 After choosing an assignment of phases for the outputs, the function 
is minimized. A simple algorithm is used which may become very expensive 
for a large number of outputs (e.g., more than 40). </DD>

<DT><B>-Dopoall</B>  </DT>
<DD>Minimize the 
function with all possible phase assignments. A range of outputs to cycle 
through can be given with <B>-rn-m</B> (the default is to use all outputs). The 
option <B>-S1</B> will perform an exact minimization for each phase assignment. 
Be warned that opoall requires an exponential number of minimizations 
! </DD>

<DT><B>-Dpair</B>  </DT>
<DD>Choose an assignment of the inputs to two-bit decoders, and minimize 
the function.  The function MUST be minimized first to achieve good results. 
 There are actually 4 different algorithms, of increasing cost, which 
may be selected with <B>-S1</B>, <B>-S2</B>, or <B>-S3</B>. The default is <B>-S0</B> which seems to give 
the best results for the cost. </DD>

<DT><B>-Dpairall</B>  </DT>
<DD>Minimize the function with all 
possible assignments of inputs to two-bit decoders. The option <B>-S1</B> will perform 
an exact minimization for each assignment of inputs to decoders, and the 
option <B>-S2</B> will perform an output-phase assignment for each assignment of 
inputs to decoders. Be warned that pairall requires an exponential number 
of minimizations ! </DD>

<DT><B>-Dseparate</B>  </DT>
<DD>Remove the don't-care set from the <FONT SIZE=-1>ON</FONT>
-set of 
the function. </DD>

<DT><B>-Dso</B>  </DT>
<DD>Minimize each function one at a time as a single-output 
function. Terms will not be shared among the functions. The option <B>-S1</B> will 
perform an exact minimization for each single-output function. </DD>

<DT><B>-Dso_both</B> 
 </DT>
<DD>Minimize each function one at a time as a single-output function, but 
choose the function or its complement based on which has fewer terms. The 
option <B>-S1</B> will perform an exact minimization for each single-output function 
and its complement to determine which has fewer terms. </DD>

<DT><B>-Dstats</B>  </DT>
<DD>Provide 
simple statistics on the size of the function. </DD>

<DT><B>-Dverify</B>  </DT>
<DD>Checks for Boolean 
equivalence of two PLA's.  Reads two filenames from the command line, each 
containing a single PLA. </DD>

<DT><B>-DPLAverify</B>  </DT>
<DD>Checks for Boolean equivalence of 
two PLA's by first permuting the columns based on the user supplied variable 
names.  Reads two filenames from the command line. </DD>

<DT><B>-eeat</B>  </DT>
<DD>Normally comments 
are echoed from the input file to the output file. This options discards 
any comments in the input file. </DD>

<DT><B>-efast</B>  </DT>
<DD>Stop after the first <FONT SIZE=-1>EXPAND</FONT>
 and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>IRREDUNDANT</FONT>
 operations (i.e., do not iterate over the solution). </DD>

<DT><B>-ekiss</B>  </DT>
<DD>Sets 
up a <I>kiss </I>-style minimization problem.  This is a hack. </DD>

<DT><B>-eness</B>  </DT>
<DD>Essential 
primes will not be detected. </DD>

<DT><B>-enirr</B>  </DT>
<DD>The result will not necessarily be 
made irredundant in the final step which removes redundant literals. </DD>

<DT><B>-enunwrap</B> 
 </DT>
<DD>The <FONT SIZE=-1>ON</FONT>
-set will not be unwrapped before beginning the minimization. </DD>

<DT><B>-eonset</B> 
 </DT>
<DD>Recompute the <FONT SIZE=-1>ON</FONT>
-set before the minimization.  Useful when the <FONT SIZE=-1>PLA</FONT>
 has 
a large number of product terms (e.g., an exhaustive list of minterms). </DD>

<DT><B>-epos</B> 
 </DT>
<DD>Swaps the <FONT SIZE=-1>ON</FONT>
-set and <FONT SIZE=-1>OFF</FONT>
-set of the function after reading the function. 
 This can be used to minimize the <FONT SIZE=-1>OFF</FONT>
-set of a function.  <I>.phase </I> (see <A HREF="man_octtools_espresso_inputs.html">espresso(5)</A>
) 
in the input file can also specify an arbitrary choice of output phases. 
</DD>

<DT><B>-estrong</B>  </DT>
<DD>Uses the alternate strategy <FONT SIZE=-1>SUPER_GASP</FONT>
 (as a replacement for 
<FONT SIZE=-1>LAST_&nbsp;GASP</FONT>
) which is more expensive, but occasionally provides better results. 
</DD>

<DT><B>-o[type]</B>  </DT>
<DD>Selects the output format.  By default, only the <FONT SIZE=-1>ON</FONT>
-set (i.e., type 
f) is output after the minimization.  [type] can be one of <B>f </B>, <B>d </B>, <B>r </B>, 
<B>fd </B>, <B>dr </B>, <B>fr </B>, or <B>fdr </B> to select any combination of the <FONT SIZE=-1>ON</FONT>
-set (f), the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>OFF</FONT>
-set (r) or the <FONT SIZE=-1>DC</FONT>
-set (d).  [type] may also be <B>eqntott </B> to output algebraic 
equations acceptable to  <I><A HREF="eqntott.1OCTTOOLS">eqntott</I>(1OCTTOOLS)</A>
,<I></I> or <B>pleasure </B> to output an 
unmerged <FONT SIZE=-1>PLA</FONT>
 (with the <I>.label </I> and <I>.group </I> keywords) acceptable to
<I><A HREF="pleasure.1OCTTOOLS">pleasure</I>(1OCTTOOLS)</A>
. 
</DD>

<DT><B>-s</B>  </DT>
<DD>Will provide a short summary of the execution of the program including 
the initial cost of the function, the final cost, and the computer resources 
used. </DD>

<DT><B>-t</B>  </DT>
<DD>Will produce a trace showing the execution of the program.  After 
each main step of the algorithm, a single line is printed which reports 
the processor time used, and the current cost of the function. </DD>

<DT><B>-x</B>  </DT>
<DD>Suppress 
printing of the solution. </DD>

<DT><B>-v [type]</B>  </DT>
<DD>Specifies verbose debugging detail. 
 Not generally useful. </DD>
</DL>
 
<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3">Diagnostics </A></H2>
Espresso will issue a warning message 
if a product term spans more than one line.  Usually this is an indication 
that the number of inputs or outputs of the function is specified incorrectly.

Default is to 
pass comments and unrecognized options from the input file to standard 
output (sometimes this isn't what you want). <P>
It is no longer possible to 
specify the type on the command line. <P>
There are a lot of options, but typical 
use doesn't need them. <P>
This manual page refers to Version 2.3 of Espresso. 
 The major change from Version 2.2 to Version 2.3 is the addition of a fast 
sparse-matrix covering algorithm for the <B>-Dexact </B> mode. <P>
The -Dopo option becomes 
very slow for many outputs (&gt; 20). <P>
